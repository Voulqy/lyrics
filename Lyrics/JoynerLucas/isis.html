<h1>"isis"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus<br>
Causing them to move around more frequently<br>
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]<br>
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)<br>
Two times for the homies in the chow hall (Whoa)<br>
Three times for them hoes on the internet<br>
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more<br>
Four times for the days that were all bad (Woo!)<br>
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)<br>
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]<br>
Kidnap a nigga like ISIS (Whoa)<br>
Turn a whole world to a crisis (Whoa)<br>
Walk around the city with a ice pick<br>
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)<br>
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo!)<br>
Beat the police with a nightstick (Boop)<br>
In my whole life, I been lifeless<br>
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk (Woo! Whoa)<br>
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out (Whoa)<br>
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house (Whoa)<br>
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch (Whoa)<br>
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out (Whoa)<br>
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow (Whoa)<br>
Errybody dissin' just to have clout (Whoa)<br>
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out<br>
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? (Whoa)<br>
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'<br>
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)<br>
I been livin' in the dungeon<br>
I done held a couple grudges<br>
Went to hell and got abducted<br>
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin<br>
I ain't settlin' for nothin'<br>
(Brap, brap, brap)<br>
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'<br>
Niggas duckin' (Bop)<br>
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' (Brrrap, brap, bop)<br>
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget<br>
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven (Bop, bop, brrrap, brap)<br>
But I got the munchies, nigga<br>
How you gon' move on the front line? (Woo!)<br>
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties (Whoa)<br>
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit<br>
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine (Joyner)<br>
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time (Woo!)<br>
We do not share the same bloodline (No)<br>
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy<br>
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time (Woo!)<br>
<br>
[Interlude]<br>
According to the American Psychiatric Association<br>
It affects roughly eight percent of children<br>
And two percent of adults<br>
Commonly believed to only affect boys<br>
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]<br>
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)<br>
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore (Whoa)<br>
Three times for them days on the block<br>
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw<br>
Four times for them days that were all bad (Woo!)<br>
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)<br>
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Logic]<br>
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)<br>
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses<br>
Everybody livin' on the surface<br>
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it<br>
What's beef?<br>
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat<br>
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all<br>
Nah, nah, what's beef?<br>
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit<br>
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street<br>
What's peace?<br>
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast<br>
When enough time pass, then you blast<br>
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict<br>
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!<br>
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit<br>
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it<br>
High and drunk, call that HD vision<br>
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision<br>
And I murder with precision all over your television<br>
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision<br>
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'<br>
That's the mission like ISIS (ISIS)<br>
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest<br>
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience<br>
I've come to body this shit (Body this shit)<br>
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis<br>
You Kelly, you pussy, you pussy<br>
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton<br>
You at Target with your mom<br>
On the internet still hatin' on my last post (I hate this nigga)<br>
I just sent a steak back at Mastro's, my god<br>
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)<br>
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses<br>
Everybody livin' on the surface<br>
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it<br>
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin<br>
And 5'9" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room<br>
Now we on the same tune, and we still the gang-dum<br>
The illest of lyricists on the same shit<br>
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit<br>
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo!<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
One time for the Grammy that I never got<br>
Two times for the Garden that I sold out<br>
Three times for the street crimes that I committed<br>
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out<br>
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard<br>
Five times Platinum with my last shit<br>
Six times for the beats and the rhymes<br>
Fuck the heat and the crime<br>
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS<br>
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS<br>
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS<br>
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS<br>
