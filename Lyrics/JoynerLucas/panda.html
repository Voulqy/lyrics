<h1>"Panda"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Yeah, Joyner<br>
Woo<br>
Ayo I'm tired of this fucking beat<br>
Ayo, how many of y'all niggas<br>
How many of y'all niggas gotta do this beat?<br>
I'm gonna kill this fucking panda, man<br>
I'm done<br>
<br>
[Chorus 1]<br>
I'm tired of this fucking panda song<br>
I don't stand alone<br>
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across<br>
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw<br>
Burn em up and turn the fucking candles on<br>
Choke em, beat em, put a couple hammers on em<br>
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on em<br>
Kick him, punch him, throw him, make him slam the wall<br>
Tie him to a cannon, make him a cannon ball<br>
Into the ocean, make him suffer too<br>
Nigga this is fucking animal abuse<br>
Animal cruelty on the fucking news<br>
I'mma kill the panda till he bloody too<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]<br>
I'll make him black and blue, fuck the black and white<br>
I don't fuck with niggas like a pack of dykes<br>
Eat the panda bitch, I got an appetite<br>
I'm out this world, I swear that I'm a satellite<br>
How many rappers gotta try to pay me?<br>
Tired of hearing niggas on the same beat<br>
Time to kill the panda in my old pajamas, flying to Atlanta in the same week<br>
What's a panda to a fucking polar bear?<br>
A gorilla to a monkey, tiger to a puppy, lion to a kitten, wolf to a pigeon, shark to a fish and snake to an infant<br>
Alligator in the water wet<br>
Joyner Lucas to a dinosaur and pet<br>
They ain't know that I'm Tyrannosaurus Rex<br>
Cut the panda up and rip apart his neck<br>
I ain't doing interviews and autographs<br>
I don't like the way you talking all of that<br>
I should fuck your bitch and never call her back<br>
I'd go down in history as an artifact<br>
But...<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2]<br>
I'm tired of this fucking panda song<br>
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across<br>
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw<br>
Burn em up and turn the fucking candles on<br>
Choke em, beat em, put a couple hammers on em<br>
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on em<br>
Kick him, hit him, make him slam the wall<br>
Tie him to a cannon, make a cannon ball<br>
Into the ocean, make him suffer too<br>
Nigga this is fucking animal abuse<br>
Animal cruelty on the fucking news<br>
I'mma kill the panda till he bloody too<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
That's a bloody mess, that's a bloody death<br>
Tell them niggas hating on me, "suck a dick"<br>
I ain't satisfied until I get to smash J-Lo and give her ass a couple kids<br>
I’ve been on Animal Planet, I got my hands on the phantom<br>
I kill it again, and nobody gotta hand me a Grammy<br>
God damnit I barely don’t even want to hear what they planning<br>
I sit in a Pana' again and then I blam with the hammer<br>
The man with a plan, you looking at the man in the mirror<br>
The man with a killer that drill a nigga straight in the building<br>
I hang with realest, I really wanna handle my business<br>
I get it, I get it. I gotta get it. Damn it, I did it<br>
I’m out of this commodity<br>
‘Bout'a be outta there, hotter than riding inside of a driver seat at Leh and Ladakh<br>
How did we get out of them out of a prodigy, nigga<br>
All I ever wanted was to hit the lottery, nigga<br>
All eyes on me and they gotta be, nigga<br>
Swear to God, 2Pac could be proud of me nigga<br>
All I know is the fire burning inside of me, nigga<br>
All I ever could be is real as I gotta be, nigga<br>
But why you all wanna act hard?<br>
Where I'm from we get it popping in the backyard<br>
Now everybody wanna run up on the back door<br>
Half pussy half bitch, you a cat-dog<br>
Let me see you do the cat daddy on a black Caddy<br>
Shorty got a fat fattie and flat belly<br>
All she do is lap giving if she act petty<br>
I'll kill a panda, throw that nigga off a balcony for running his mouth to me<br>
And y'all done got me mad<br>
I'mma put the panda in a body bag<br>
What you doing 'round here? Why you standing 'round?<br>
Why you niggas tryna lollygag?<br>
You ain't got a life and you proud of that?<br>
All you wanna know is where the molly at<br>
All you hoes think about is Prada bags<br>
I done killed the panda, where Desiigner at? (Nigga)<br>
But this is not a diss, don't call it that<br>
I'm just giving all you pandas hepatitis, cancer, HIV and a heart attack<br>
All you broke bitches need to call a cab<br>
Cause I ain't (laughs)<br>
Yo, stop rapping over this Goddamn beat cause I ain't too fond of that<br>
Look<br>
<br>
[Chorus 3]<br>
I'm tired of this fucking panda song<br>
I don't stand alone<br>
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across<br>
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw<br>
Burn em up and turn the fucking candles on<br>
Choke em, beat em, put a couple hammers on em<br>
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on em like<br>
Like, like this (brrraaaa)<br>
