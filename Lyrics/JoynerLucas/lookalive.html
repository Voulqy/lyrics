<h1>"Look Alive"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
All you a lie<br>
Nigga, I ain't ever been a "yes" man<br>
All you gonna die, you can get murdered on webcam<br>
I don't get tired; sweat through a headband<br>
You might look alive, that's 'cause you don't really know you a dead man<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
This is God's plan, someone stop me<br>
I've been sent here from Illuminati<br>
Evil scriptures written on my body<br>
Me and Satan pull up in a red Ferrari<br>
Don't be tryin' to put your fuckin' arm around me<br>
44 shots traumatizin' from the .45, hit 44 more<br>
Carbon copies say you kamikazes<br>
That's for e'rybody<br>
Mama, Poppy<br>
Sister, Brother, Cousin, Uncle, Auntie<br>
This is not Versace, this is hot hibachi<br>
This is Hiroshima, this is Nagasaki<br>
I'm Mahatma Gandhi, a fuckin' humanoid Anunnaki<br>
With plenty hammers when I'm ridin' shotty<br>
Better use your manners when you talk about me<br>
Ain't too hard to find me<br>
I've been killin' niggas, still ain't nothin' left though<br>
Joyner Lucas sicker than a strep throat<br>
Spanish bitch that wanna give me besos<br>
They must've forgot I was next up<br>
Speed out your crib right after I clean out your shit and then put All of your fuckin' money in a escrow<br>
Fuck what you sayin', I'm not the one that you play with<br>
I think they really mistaken, I wasn't next up?<br>
You thought wrong and you all gone, all done<br>
I just might bring back Don Juan, I just might bring back Sean John<br>
Tell P Diddy that I'm on one<br>
I'ma beat it down with a Du-Rag<br>
Pussy ate out, that's a PopCon<br>
If I don't fuck with you, that's too bad (God damn)<br>
Ho, you played out like the thong song<br>
Ain't no bygones bein' bygones<br>
I should murder niggas when I buy guns<br>
Ho, you get stretched like Nylon<br>
This is my band, I'm Dylon<br>
All I wanna do is just drop bombs<br>
On you cheerleadin' niggas with the pom-poms<br>
My Jamaica bitch got socks on<br>
Every time I hit it she be like, "wagwan"<br>
Peter Piper picked a pepper, and I picked the pressure<br>
Pick a fight, I pick a side, I put you on a stretcher<br>
Peter Piper picked up a nine, I put it together<br>
Started poppin' at the people, they 'bout to meet the Beretta<br>
Better meet the metal, I'ma need a Fujita to measure<br>
Put you deeper than what's deeper the sea or the desert<br>
I've been schemin' while I'm creepin', like fifty feet to the Jetta<br>
Niggas speed and hit the pedal, I put my feet in the metal<br>
God damn!<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride<br>
Nigga, this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god<br>
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied<br>
I ain't got no fuckin' job, this my life, this my, wait—<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
All of y'all wishy and washy<br>
All y'all my kids in a car seat<br>
I take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi<br>
Lyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands<br>
I think I need to find you a hobby<br>
God got a plan, hope that God hold your hand<br>
I think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!<br>
Tell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit<br>
And I'm comin' back to get even<br>
I went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region<br>
I let off this mac for no reason<br>
You are now witnessin' greatness<br>
I'm practically preachin' and this is the passion of Jesus<br>
And all you basic motherfuckas are lackin' achievement<br>
And I've just been laughin' and geekin'<br>
Back to business, I got mad intentions<br>
I ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions<br>
But it's competition, I'm a savage winnin'<br>
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician<br>
I don't see you niggas, I've been lackin' vision<br>
You've been actin' different, I've been actin' distant<br>
I'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention<br>
You gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!<br>
This is uncomfortable, you just keep puttin' your feet in a fire<br>
I think my gun got a crush on you, boy<br>
You 'bout to meet your secret admirer<br>
How you do shit you don't wanna do?<br>
I do that shit just to keep me inspired<br>
I used to hit it and leave when I wanted to<br>
Now I hit it and be sleepin' aside her, woo<br>
Roll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em<br>
Put that motherfuckin' smoke up on 'em with that holy water<br>
Joyner Lucas, I'm a holy mona leader motor runnin'<br>
Man, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it<br>
Prayed about it to the Lord about it in the mornin', but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out<br>
I ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down<br>
Don't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride<br>
Nigga this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god<br>
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied<br>
I ain't got no fuckin' job, this my life, this my<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
This is God's plan, someone stop me<br>
I was sent here from Illuminati<br>
Evil scriptures written on my body<br>
Me and Satan pull up in a red Buggati<br>
Don't be tryna put your fuckin' arm around me<br>
Bring the drama, it ain't hard to find me<br>
This a lucid dream, this a out-of-body<br>
UFO flyin' while I'm ridin' shotty<br>
I'm a ninja, pull up on a Kawasaki<br>
187 on the cops behind me<br>
This is Hiroshima, this is Nagasaki<br>
I'm Mahatma Gandhi in a Maserati, god damn<br>
Now call me Papi<br>
Plenty hammers when I'm ridin' shotty<br>
Better use your manners when you talk about me<br>
It ain't hard to find me, motherfucker<br>
My name Joyner<br>
<br><br>
