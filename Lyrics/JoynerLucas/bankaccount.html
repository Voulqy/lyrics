<h1>"Bank Account"</h1><br>

[Chorus]<br>
I'm willing to die for this shit<br>
I'm ready to flip it and end up in prison the rest of my life for this shit<br>
So my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion<br>
I end up surviving this shit<br>
And if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money<br>
I'd probably be robbing and shit<br>
Don't know how much I cry for this shit<br>
Said I am willing to ride for this shit<br>
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit<br>
Niggas say that I'm cursed 'cause I go to church and stare at the Bible and shit<br>
Shawty say I'm the worst cause I do my dirt, and I don't be hiding this shit<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Bitch, I'm a savage I spit at you bastards, I wonder what you gonna do to me hoe<br>
I need to hear some more rapping<br>
I'm just not impressed by your cash or your jewelry, ho<br>
All you my soldiers and I'm a lieutenant<br>
Goddammit, you should be saluting me, ho<br>
I hope you know I ain't going nowhere<br>
All you rappers just better get used to me, ho<br>
Nigga, I'm Mr. Blue with my jeans, bought me a jeep, cause I wasn't riding as much<br>
My bank account looking weak, don't look at me, I ain't got time for no fun<br>
Starting to feel like Tyrese, I'm 'bout to trip, and maybe start crying or som'<br>
I might just hit up the Smith's, throw me a fit and wait for my wire to come<br>
Ain't nobody give or show me love when I was coming up, I had to double up and tell these niggas buckle up before they ride<br>
And they don't really wanna knuckle up, I hit 'em with the uppercut, I had these motherfuckers running for they life<br>
Unidentified craft when I'm flying past, I'm an alien sailin' and if you look up in the sky<br>
Blow your mind back, put your eyes back to your iPad, I'm an Iraqi in suicide<br>
When the bombs are loaded and your mind explode in the wind<br>
And you gon' sit down, repent<br>
I was raised in the sewer; me and the 𝘐𝘵 clown are friends<br>
Red balloons for your kids, sink my tooth in ya bitch<br>
I lost too many friends, I don't do good with kids<br>
What you know about riding dirty in the evening?<br>
What you know about Ramen Noodles, and a pack of sazon seasoning<br>
What you know about leaving the oven door open when there's no heat again<br>
And the rent is due and your landlord try and throw you out on the streets again<br>
Nigga, I was always dreaming of a Bentley and a fucking Lamborghini when I win 'em, I'ma finally get a break<br>
If I didn't get it way before, I guarantee that if I talk to God, then I can say I got it when I prayed<br>
She don't really want me to get petty, turn her dime into a penny, but she know I got a lot of shit to say<br>
I can turn some water into henny, drink it up and let the semi shoot, I'll pop you niggas all up in the face<br>
Blood all up in the lake, I<br>
Wanna see your wake die<br>
They don't wanna wave bye<br>
Creep when I came by, teeth like a K9<br>
Bleed through your Levi, we from the East Side<br>
Eat when the beat's hot, tea from the teapot<br>
Aim for the tree top, beg till your knees pop<br>
Skrrt in a Nissan, swerve into three cars<br>
You just a bird in a beehive, you just a cold in a room full of germs<br>
Nigga, I said all of my idols and favorite rappers ain't been rhyming a lot<br>
What the fuck happened to Jay Electronica? I wonder if he still got it or not<br>
Whatever happened to Elzhi?<br>
Whatever happened to Meth? What happened to Beans? Whatever happened to Lauryn?<br>
What happened to Banks? Tell me what happened to Bleek?<br>
What the fuck happened to Mos? What happened to Missy?<br>
Nigga, what happened to Ghost?<br>
Whatever happened to Cube?<br>
What up with Common? What the fuck, where did they go?<br>
Tell me what happened to Budden's, what about Luda?<br>
I hope they ain't losing it now<br>
Hope they get back to the music 'cause I need some new shit<br>
I'm sick of these new niggas out, I'm that new nigga now<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight<br>
Nine niggas wanna war, 10 niggas on the floor, 11 niggas on the porch<br>
12 killers wanna war, 13 carnivores, 14 Labradors, 15 dinosaurs, 16 Avatars<br>
17 bombs or grenades at your rental car, 18 ways you can die when you have it all<br>
I got I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight<br>
Nine bitches wanna fuck, 10 niggas wanna rush, 11 hitters on a bus<br>
12 think they one of us, 13 other guns, 14 runners-up, 15 rubber gloves, 16 double pumps<br>
17 shots in your face till you cuddle up, 18 ways you can die tryna fuck with us<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I'm willing to die for this shit<br>
Said I'm ready to flip it and end up in prison the rest of my life for this shit<br>
And my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion<br>
I end up surviving this shit<br>
Shit if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money<br>
I'll probably be robbing this shit<br>
Don't know how much I cry for this shit<br>
Said I am willing to die for this shit<br>
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit<br>
Niggas say that I'm cursed 'cause I go to church and stare at the Bible and shit<br>
Shawty say I'm the worst cause I do my dirt, and I don't be hiding this shit<br>
Joyner, wooh!<br>
