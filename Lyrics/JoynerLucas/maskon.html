<h1>"Mask On"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Uh<br>
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner<br>
Sober minds<br>
Dead silence<br>
Yuh, listen, look<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I don't take no fucking percocets<br>
Molly, Percocets<br>
No ecstasy, promethazine<br>
No lean, no purple mess<br>
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step<br>
If you don't think that I'm the shit, it's just cause you ain't heard me yet<br>
I'm 'bout to put my mask on, my mask on<br>
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone<br>
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long<br>
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I'm about to grab niggas by the throat<br>
I'm about to crash Lil Yachty boat<br>
I'm about to drag niggas by the coat<br>
Take out your trash, sit it by the door<br>
Shit, I got the mask on me, I'm 'bout to go<br>
I hate when niggas act funny when I'm alone<br>
And try to give daps to me and tip their hats to me<br>
And they act gully when they at home<br>
Yeah, I don't do Xannies or Mollys<br>
Don't come near me with problems<br>
And don't you compare me to Logic (never)<br>
Go listen to Sriracha<br>
Yeah, that's Amanda to Ronda<br>
And that's a Benz to a Honda<br>
Yeah, that's a dance with the devil<br>
And I ain't dancing behind ya<br>
My nigga, I'm a muthafucking entity<br>
You don't get it, even landlords gotta pay rent to me<br>
Gingerbread man fuckers ain't catchin' me<br>
Sick and tired of niggas sickening, depressing me<br>
Go to church, I testify<br>
Pray to God I bless the beat<br>
Kanye said "Touch the Sky"<br>
Future might come for me<br>
But I'm a fucking beast and if I die, that sucks for me<br>
But where the crown I'ma kill the king<br>
I bet a lot of haters won't feel the same<br>
I dug the ground, I built the ring<br>
I cut the cow I milked the game, nigga<br>
I should cut a hole in the sky<br>
Make you feel the rain, nigga feel the pain, nigga<br>
A lot of rap niggas get nervous when they hear my name, nigga<br>
I'm insane, nigga<br>
Back when you was watching Leave It To Beaver<br>
I was crushing on Tila Tequila<br>
I was swagging in Adidas and Filas<br>
Fuckin' divas call 'em Venus, Serena<br>
Signed my deal and told em Cesar's a beater<br>
Hope you didn't think I needed you neither<br>
Take it back and told 'em I didn't mean it<br>
'Cause my uncle said it's cheaper to keep it<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
Mask off, run in the back door<br>
Blast y'all hats off<br>
Fuck is you mad for?<br>
I catch y'all, smash y'all<br>
Don't mean to laugh hard<br>
But all you funny to me<br>
None of you niggas half hard<br>
You think you comin' for but you never could last long<br>
You don't mean nothin' to me<br>
And I come with some shit that'll make you niggas {Imitates mumble rap flow}<br>
Like that mumble rap shit (laugh)<br>
Whoo, whoo!<br>
Mask off, run in the back door<br>
Blast y'all hats off<br>
Fuck is you mad for?<br>
I catch y'all, smash y'all<br>
Don't mean to laugh hard<br>
But all you funny to me<br>
None of you niggas half hard<br>
You runnin comin' for me but you never could last long<br>
You don't mean nothin' to me<br>
And I come with some shit<br>
That'll make you niggas bump into me with a couple of weapons<br>
And be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean<br>
What's up with you mumble niggas that never say nothin'?<br>
I'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven<br>
I go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother<br>
And you ain't telling me nothing<br>
I mean I'm very disgustin'<br>
I mean I'm ready to bust and<br>
Put an end to you fucker, now what's what?<br>
How many CDs could a woodchuck chuck<br>
If he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?<br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Look, all you a lie<br>
I don't cuff no hoes, you can have my bitch<br>
I don't even mind<br>
It seems like all these hoes wanna do is switch up<br>
They rather be a guy<br>
If she could suck my dick everyday for a living<br>
Then that'd be her job, yuh<br>
I said candy paint in yo fuckin' rims<br>
.38 in yo fuckin' Benz<br>
I was broke as fuck had a couple friends<br>
A refrigerator and a cup of gin<br>
Let's drink it up, me and you<br>
'Cause these niggas fake, and I see it too<br>
And they try to get me to pop Percocets and Molly<br>
And I said<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I don't take no fucking percocets<br>
Molly, Percocets<br>
No ecstasy, promethazine<br>
No lean, no purple mess<br>
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step<br>
If you don't think that I'm the shit its just cause you ain't heard me yet<br>
I'm about to put my mask on, my mask on<br>
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone<br>
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long<br>
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
Mask off, run in the back door<br>
Blast y'all hats off<br>
Fuck is you mad for?<br>
I catch y'all, smash y'all<br>
Don't mean to laugh hard<br>
But all you funny to me<br>
None of you niggas half hard<br>
You think you comin' for but you never could last long<br>
You don't mean nothin' to me<br>
And I come up some shit I (inaudible)<br>
Whoo, whoo!<br>
Mask off, run in the back door<br>
Blast y'all hats off<br>
Fuck is you mad for?<br>
I catch y'all, smash y'all<br>
Don't mean to laugh hard<br>
But all you funny to me<br>

What the fuck? Fuck!<br>
