<h1>"Gucci Gang"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Yuh, yuh, uh<br>
Woo, (Joyner), yuh, yuh, yuh, yup<br>
Pandora, Pandora, Pandora<br>
I don't really fuck with no... (yo)<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Gucci gang, Louis gang, Fendi gang, Dolce gang<br>
'Sace gang, Prada gang, lot of gangs (Woo)<br>
I don't really fuck with no brand names (Woah)<br>
Joyner 'bout to go on a rampage (Ooh)<br>
They don't wanna see me let the chopper bang, yeah<br>
Get this bitch jumping like Shabba Ranks, ooh<br>
What's a Lil Pump to a rocket flame, yeah<br>
Turn your pink dreads into pocket chains (Woo)<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
All you new rappers don't be talkin' 'bout shit except doin' drugs<br>
Wonder how you got a name (Damn)<br>
Sippin' lean, takin' E, Percocets, Purple drank, Xanax, everything sound the same, fuck<br>
Bunch of drug addicts in the house of pain (Woo)<br>
Hope you niggas suffer til you pop a vein, yeah<br>
This shit made your mother wanna ovulate, yeah<br>
This shit make conductors wanna stop a train<br>
Gucci, Fendi, Louis, Prada, Dolce (Dolce)<br>
Back when I was broke and no one know me (Woah)<br>
I couldn't afford it and now that I got the money<br>
I don't even want this shit 'cause it ain't for me (Joyner)<br>
I always been myself, you don't know me (Woah)<br>
Yeah I was so depressed, I was lonely<br>
The man on the horse, all I had was Ralph Lauren<br>
Then I went and signed a deal and bought a pony (Woah)<br>
Yeah I'm taking it back and then I'm smacking you bitches and laughing<br>
And I'm killing them, hacking them, and sending your body right back to them<br>
You wonder what's happening<br>
I'm flipping new syllables, acronyms<br>
I guess I'ma practice it<br>
You fuckers are fucking embarrassing (Pow pow)<br>
You ain't gonna be happy when I'm on top and I'm gonna be popping<br>
All of you gonna be dropping like birds dropping all on your conscious<br>
All you niggas watchin I'm spittin', slap all on your coffin, R.I.P<br>
You lost and you fuckas sleepin' you're pillow talkin' (Pow pow pow pow)<br>
And you dream all day, that's per year (Per year)<br>
All you hoe niggas leave your purse here (Purse here)<br>
I am your favorite rapper's worst fear (Why?)<br>
Raised in the mud crying, dirt tears (Woah)<br>
Just a bunch of kids in the high chair<br>
Couldn't get a buzz even if you had lightyear<br>
Wouldn't get no love even if your heart's right here<br>
Niggas got guns so nobody want to fight fair, no<br>
Hit 'em with the Ric Flair and the suplex<br>
I ain't never been scared, bitch, I'm ruthless (Woo)<br>
Raised by the ghetto<br>
Know some gangs that'll get 'em<br>
Split 'em right down the middle like a fuckin' duplex<br>
Break a nigga toes, make 'em do the two-step<br>
Crib full of hoes, now I feel like Hugh Hef<br>
Got a bad stripper bitch, all we do is have sex<br>
And she love suckin' dick so I call her loose neck (Woah)<br>
Makin' a panic with my shit and I'm flippin' up banisters<br>
I'm ready to handle and dismantle and crush and vanish<br>
I hit 'em and send 'em into walls, then I got' em enchanted<br>
Then my fuckin hands that holdin the hammer bangin' and slammin'<br>
Killin' 'em in the ambulance, they dyin', they bleedin', they tremblin'<br>
I'm really sick and I got a stiff as a fuckin' mannequin<br>
I paint a picture a Picasso vision, all on my cellophane<br>
I got 'em swingin' they on my dick and grabbin my pants again<br>
Now, uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco (Cinco)<br>
I ain't Spanish but I know the lingo (Lingo)<br>
Atlantic told me that my flow a hundred<br>
But my album ain't come unless I got a fuckin' single<br>
Well I don't give a fuck about no hit record<br>
I'ma just remix y'all shit and get big off it<br>
I'ma just murder every mother fucking beat while I'm dreaming of gettin' paid in my mother fuckin' sleep, goddamn<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Gucci gang, Louis gang, Fendi gang, Dolce gang<br>
'Sace gang, Prada gang, lot of gangs (Woah)<br>
I don't really fuck with no brand names<br>
Joyner 'bout to go on a rampage, ooh<br>
They don't wanna see me let the chopper bang (Yeah)<br>
Get this bitch jumping like Shabba Ranks, yeah<br>
What's a Lil Pump to a rocket flame, woo<br>
Gucci gang, Fendi gang, Prada gang (Yeah)<br>
All you new rappers don't be talkin' 'bout shit except doin' drugs<br>
Wonder how you got a name, uh<br>
Sippin' lean, takin' E, Percocets, Purple drank, Xanax, everything sound the same, fuck<br>
Bunch of drug addicts in the house of pain (Bruh)<br>
And all you niggas suffer til you pop a vein, uh<br>
Gucci gang, Fendi gang, Prada gang (Woo)<br>
I don't really fuck with no brand names, yeah<br>
