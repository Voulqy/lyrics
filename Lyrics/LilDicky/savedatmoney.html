<h1>"$ave Dat Money"</h1><br>

[Intro: Lil Dicky & Fetty Wap]<br>
LD, AKA The Independent Variable<br>
Trap God, and we servin' out the hallway<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Fetty Wap]<br>
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Fuck I need gold for man?)<br>
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Fuck I need clothes for man?)<br>
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?<br>
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow dat, baby<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money<br>
What we doin'? We gon' save dat money<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Lil Dicky & Fetty Wap]<br>
The rap game got it all wrong<br>
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on 'em<br>
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)<br>
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check<br>
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed (No)<br>
Those margaritas not goin' on my card (No)<br>
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake<br>
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress<br>
Hold up<br>
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L the Jew biz major? (Ayy)<br>
Fuck you know about the world he raised in?<br>
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker 13<br>
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday (It's true)<br>
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away (It's true)<br>
Book flight December but I leave in May (I do)<br>
Drugs are generic but still work the same<br>
I get logins for Netflix from my cousin Greg<br>
Thanks Greg!<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Fetty Wap]<br>
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Yeah baby)<br>
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Yeah baby)<br>
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?<br>
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I’m so Jewish)<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I’m so frugal)<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I'm so imprudent)<br>
What we do? We gon' save that money<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]<br>
All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God, nigga<br>
All of my bitches be scared of me, I put that rod in 'em<br>
All of them bitches actin' thoughtless, I disregardin' them<br>
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em<br>
I can teach a lil' nigga somethin' like a preacher<br>
I can take his ass to church fresh as hell, no Easter<br>
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup<br>
I could...<br>
<br>
[Interlude: Lil Dicky]<br>
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?<br>
You know what a full verse would have been too expensive anyways<br>
I think<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]<br>
Trap, trap, trap<br>
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie (Please)<br>
Hair cut several months in-between, homie (Always)<br>
Hit the mafuckin' lights when I leave, homie (YOLO)<br>
Single ply TP, ass bleed<br>
Airbnb the motherfuckin' lease, I'm never there<br>
I'm out in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?<br>
At happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care<br>
And that applies to both dating and wings<br>
Peep matinees, phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it (All the fam)<br>
401K, rollin' over bands on it (Ayy)<br>
Coppin' sweaters in the summer when the sale on 'em (I'm hot)<br>
The fuck you rappers bragging 'bout? You overpaying for it<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Fetty Wap]<br>
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Yeah baby)<br>
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Yeah baby)<br>
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?<br>
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I’m judicious)<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I’m cost efficient)<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I do it different)<br>
What we do? We gon' save that money<br>
<br>
[Verse 4: Lil Dicky]<br>
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover (Never)<br>
Low thread count, hard with the covers (Woo)<br>
Free trial memberships, though<br>
I never join the shiz though (Ayy)<br>
Fuck you think this is though?<br>
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin' finch though (Brr)<br>
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick<br>
Just so I can whet the appetite a bit<br>
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?<br>
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans though (Ayy)<br>
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands, though (Ayy)<br>
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo (Ayy)<br>
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke (Ayy)<br>
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around<br>
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down<br>
My dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?<br>
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me, well I fuckin' don't!<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Fetty Wap]<br>
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Yeah baby)<br>
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Yeah baby)<br>
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?<br>
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, 1738)<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I'm a kike)<br>
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I eat figs)<br>
What we do? We gon' save that money<br>
<br>
[Bridge: Fetty Wap]<br>
Every time these niggas tryna play<br>
And lately I've been stackin' up crazy<br>
Stackin' up 'cause all about the bands, baby<br>
800K underneath the bed baby<br>
<br>
[Outro: Lil Dicky]<br>
If you at a restaurant and got a iced coffee<br>
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution<br>
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see he double charged ya<br>
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem<br>
Sing along like<br>
Ohh, don't double charge me for that<br>
Don't double charge me, we like<br>
Ohh, don't double charge me for that<br>
Don't do it to yourself<br>
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth<br>
What the ice cube's worth<br>
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk<br>
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be (Brr)<br>
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B<br>
But think about it, bruh, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side<br>
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon<br>
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger<br>
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision<br>
I would hate to be the waiter tryna tell me something different<br>
I'ma get on Yelp in a minute and review<br>
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how<br>
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...<br>
Oh, it was just an accident?<br>
You didn't even mean that<br>
You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed<br>
<br><br>
