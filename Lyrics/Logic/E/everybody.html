<h1>"Everybody"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now<br>
Sit the fuck back down<br>
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood<br>
Oh, it’s like that now?<br>
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now<br>
I'ma show 'em how to act<br>
I'ma show 'em how to act<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round<br>
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man<br>
Run, mothafucka, run<br>
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!<br>
Everybody know you ain't about it<br>
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it<br>
Red light, stop. Green light, go!<br>
Everything ain't what it seem like<br>
Mothafucka I know!<br>
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?<br>
Bitch, I been in<br>
This is merely the beginning again<br>
What you been living in?<br>
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?<br>
Looking for something to complete us<br>
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist<br>
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us<br>
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus<br>
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us<br>
And I wish I could erase that, face facts<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something<br>
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go<br>
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something<br>
Everybody love, everybody know<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness<br>
God as my witness, I'm with this<br>
But on the real, I think I need another witness!<br>
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing<br>
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga<br>
Well I'll be God damned, go figure<br>
In my blood is the slave and the master<br>
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor<br>
But he was born with the white privilege!<br>
Man, what the fuck is that?<br>
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys<br>
I should be ashamed to be black<br>
And some black people look ashamed when I rap<br>
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back<br>
Not accepted by the black or the white<br>
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light<br>
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that<br>
I wish I could erase that, face facts<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something<br>
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go<br>
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something<br>
Everybody love, everybody know<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now<br>
Sit the fuck back down<br>
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood<br>
Oh, it's like that now?<br>
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now<br>
I'ma show 'em how to act<br>
I'ma show 'em how to act<br>
