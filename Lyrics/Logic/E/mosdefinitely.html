<h1>"Mos Definitely"</h1><br>

[Verse 1]<br>
I don't know what I’ma do<br>
I don't know where I’ma live<br>
'Cause it feel like I ain't got nothing to give<br>
Just wanna follow my dreams<br>
Just wanna follow my heart<br>
But the world wanna tear me apart right from start<br>
Everything I ever wanted, it ain't what I thought<br>
Bring it back to the roots like my name Black Thought<br>
This shit right here, no it can't be taught<br>
Gotta be learned, it gotta be earned<br>
I ain't got a pocket full of money but I'm full of hope<br>
I don't wanna rob people, I don't wanna push dope<br>
I just wanna live, I just wanna maintain<br>
Like a bullet to the brain<br>
Gotta play the game like a chess board<br>
If yah wanna go to war, gotta bring yah best sword<br>
I feel like I'm going crazy, like I need a psych ward<br>
Think my mind playing tricks on me like a Geto Boy<br>
Feel like I need to murder 'em in the moment I deploy<br>
Everybody, anybody, somebody fill the void, somebody fill the void<br>
Listen, I don't wanna work a job, motherfuck a 9 to 5<br>
Every time I get a check, what I really get? Robbed<br>
Livin in America, this shit is a facade<br>
But you gotta push through and persevere, word to God<br>
Tryna find a home, but I can't afford a home<br>
'Cause I'm 25 and owe a hunnid grand in student loans<br>
Tryna get healthcare, but I'm on welfare<br>
Man I swear to god, I wish I was living in Bel Air<br>
Fuck Medicaid, I just wanna get paid<br>
Wit' a couple bad bitches at the crib, gettin' laid<br>
That's what I'm taught by the media<br>
Television tellin' my vision to get greedier<br>
Come now everybody stay tune like T-Pain<br>
Operate the drive in yah mind like a keychain<br>
Come now folk, get woke, stay woke<br>
'Cause the white man want the black man stay broke<br>
Fuck that, I'm finna buck back<br>
But not wit bullets, I’ma use my education to the fullest<br>
I’ma get out of debt, I'ma reset<br>
I’ma get out of debt, I'ma reset<br>
Do whatever you gotta do whenever to live<br>
But you gotta remember to give back when you get that When you finally get to the top and you hit that pinnacle<br>
I ain't being cynical, I'm just being real<br>
I believe that everybody feel, everybody feel, listen up Everybody over here<br>
I promise to God on everything it ain't nothing to fear Anybody that can hear, just fight<br>
Fight for the right<br>
Fight for ya life<br>
Fight for what you believe is right<br>
Fight for what you believe is right<br>
Everybody fight<br>
Everybody fight<br>
Matter fact, everybody beautiful<br>
But right, what now I need<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
