<h1>"Black SpiderMan"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Jesus, Black Jesus<br>
Jesus, Black Jesus<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I been feeling so down<br>
I think they should know now<br>
I think they should know what's up<br>
That's that road I been down<br>
I know how it go down<br>
I know how it go now, what's up<br>
I feel like I don’t belong<br>
I feel like my life is wrong<br>
I feel like I don’t know what's up<br>
What's up, what's up<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Ayy<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
I ain’t here to pick and choose<br>
I ain't here to sing the blues<br>
I’m just here to spread the clues<br>
I’m just here to spread the news<br>
Everybody know I do<br>
Listen<br>
I ain’t ashamed to be white<br>
I ain’t ashamed to be Black<br>
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact<br>
I know you fucking with that<br>
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be<br>
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be<br>
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good<br>
Sometimes I’m misunderstood<br>
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off<br>
They feel like I'm fading<br>
I'm right out my mind<br>
Tell 'em!<br>
Momma don't love me<br>
Daddy don't love me<br>
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly<br>
You could be anything you wanna be<br>
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be<br>
Let him hate let em love<br>
Wondering if everybody still like this up above<br>
When that push come to shove<br>
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like<br>
I just wanna be free<br>
Not a slave to the stereotype<br>
All alone in my room in the middle of the night<br>
I don’t have the words but my stereo might<br>
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today<br>
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye<br>
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin<br>
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him<br>
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone<br>
Looking for a man and a home to call my own<br>
But I already have one<br>
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son<br>
Son, say:<br>
Black is beautiful<br>
Be black and proud<br>
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud<br>
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa<br>
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha<br>
I’m biracial so bye Felicia<br>
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher<br>
Maybe Jesus was black<br>
Maybe Jesus had dreads<br>
Spiderman should be black<br>
I vote for Glover instead<br>
Glover instead<br>
Like what's up<br>
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more<br>
I vote for so much more<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I been feeling so down<br>
I think they should know now<br>
I think they should know what's up<br>
That's that road I been down<br>
I know how it go down<br>
I know how it go now, what's up<br>
I feel like I don’t belong<br>
I feel like my life is wrong<br>
I feel like I don’t know what's up<br>
What's up, what's up<br>
<br>
[Bridge: Logic & Damian]<br>
Go on and let your soul glow<br>
Let your soul glow<br>
Glow<br>
Shine and glow<br>
Let it glow<br>
Glow<br>
Let, let it<br>
Black Spiderman can he save a brother now<br>
Black Spiderman can he save a brother now<br>
Yeah<br>
Let your soul glow<br>
