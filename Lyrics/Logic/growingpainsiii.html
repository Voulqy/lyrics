<h1>"Growing Pains III"</h1><br>

[Skit]<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Uh, yeah, outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin'<br>
And the police they rushin'<br>
Go to my head like concussion<br>
I'd rather not have this discussion<br>
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood<br>
Where my mind, don’t know now<br>
But I know where it was<br>
I need Nikki, where is Nikki<br>
Baby girl please come and get me<br>
Now I’m old and shit is trippy, but I know that God is with me<br>
This that baby mama drama<br>
Give a fuck about a man I know I'ma<br>
Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun<br>
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month<br>
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt<br>
That welfare check, check<br>
Won’t ever bounce like my daddy did<br>
But I’m glad he did 'cause it made me strong<br>
Made me help somebody with this song<br>
Paint the picture of my life<br>
Growing up what it was like<br>
Section 8, grab a plate<br>
Food for thought, gravitate<br>
Food stamps, social services tryna take me away<br>
My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today<br>
Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that’s all I know<br>
Just me and my homies, people that know me<br>
Only ones that know<br>
Around my way, living day by day<br>
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs<br>
Five-O with them K-9's<br>
Manhunt when it's game time<br>
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day<br>
Now I’m running from the police<br>
Don’t know how, but I got away<br>
Selling weed to my homies<br>
And a girl in the building that know me<br>
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen<br>
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean<br>
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do<br>
Such a youngin, such a fool<br>
Now I’m breaking into school<br>
'Cause my homie told me to<br>
What to do, what would you?<br>
When will I lose my anonymity<br>
And become one with the enemy?<br>
Tell me would I be the enemy<br>
Feel like nobody in front of me<br>
I can feel the vibe<br>
<br>
[Interlude]<br>
Bobby what are you thinking?<br>
What are you dreaming about?<br>
Bobby, what’s inside?<br>
What are you thinking right now?<br>
What are you thinking?<br>
Go to sleep<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I guess maybe I was thinking things would be different now<br>
'Cause when I wake up my dreams fade<br>
Everything cascade<br>
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames<br>
Why must I open my eyes<br>
I wish I could stay asleep forever<br>
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever<br>
Will it happen, maybe never<br>
Maybe so, I got to know—but tell me why<br>
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming<br>
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons?<br>
Maybe not—All I know is this life I live<br>
I can’t live it no longer<br>
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive<br>
Turn on the TV, let it wash my brain<br>
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain<br>
Hello children, how was school?<br>
It was good, how bout you?<br>
I love you (I love you son), I love mama too<br>
Are you ready for dinner?<br>
I’m able to set the table<br>
Till I snap out the fable when that TV turn off<br>
And I realize I’m back in hell (Bobby...)<br>
<br>
[Outro: Thalia]<br>
