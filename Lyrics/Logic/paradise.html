<h1>"Paradise"</h1><br>

[Part 1]<br>
<br>
[Intro]<br>
Church, yeah<br>
Now this that—<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Logic]<br>
Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious<br>
I wonder where is this, hold up<br>
Get the fuck out my business, show enough<br>
We roll up then load up<br>
Just a bastard born out of wedlock<br>
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock<br>
Got my sites on deadlock<br>
Visions of my enemy in a headlock<br>
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble<br>
Just a youngin' in trouble<br>
Took a shot and then made it a double<br>
Took a shot and then made it a double<br>
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good<br>
No ingredients in my hood<br>
But a tablespoon of this baking soda<br>
Gon' make it good, like it should<br>
That's ignant isn't it, hold up wait<br>
Now take a look at my pigment<br>
Tell me again, we can never be kin<br>
Based on the color of my skin<br>
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin<br>
That's a club I don't wanna be in<br>
My DNA get done integrated<br>
My God it's innovative<br>
That's a million miles away from administrative<br>
I fuckin' hate it, anyway—<br>
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park<br>
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive<br>
Police would knock on the door, I would hide<br>
Then they would talk to me and I would lie<br>
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45<br>
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away<br>
Over down on the driveway<br>
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade<br>
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that "My Way"<br>
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn<br>
Now I'm a grown man, oh man<br>
What the fuck done happened to the plan<br>
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy (crazy)<br>
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep (why)<br>
Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker<br>
Wide awake on the creep tryna kill you and he will too<br>
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal<br>
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel<br>
My son, my seed watch 'em grow and then watch 'em lead<br>
Let me proceed, bumpin' that Californication, by the Red Hot<br>
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot<br>
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me<br>
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC<br>
<br>
[Chorus 1: Jesse Boykins III]<br>
Follow me to paradise<br>
Follow, follow me<br>
Follow me to paradise<br>
Follow me to paradise<br>
Follow, follow me<br>
Follow me to paradise<br>
<br>
[Part 2]<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Logic]<br>
I remember my life long ago in my adolescence<br>
I could feel the presence in my residence<br>
Hesitant even thought it was evident<br>
I should get the fuck—<br>
I know something is wrong<br>
Yeah, I know something is wrong<br>
Feel like my mind gone<br>
I know I play along, I might drown in this song<br>
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this<br>
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice<br>
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed<br>
Shit maybe then I'm noticed, huh, but maybe not<br>
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious<br>
So outrageous my age is on my mind<br>
Walking to work and I go blind<br>
Sippin' on that Koolaid<br>
Gettin' big wig money, that's toupée<br>
Look around and see people with no class<br>
Like snow on a school day<br>
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do<br>
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu<br>
Livin' life how I do is crazy<br>
This shit never amaze me<br>
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why<br>
All I know is my mind racing<br>
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it<br>
Yeah, I be pacing, bitch I'm back again<br>
Been here since way back when<br>
Now let that shit begin, yeah<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2: Logic]<br>
This album two but this song was written before the first<br>
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst<br>
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise<br>
But it only makes it that much better when I rise<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Logic]<br>
This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it<br>
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming "I knew it!"<br>
This is real, so real<br>
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill<br>
Most of these people will never hit fruition<br>
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition<br>
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle<br>
All alone with no one to dial<br>
I'm just a man, I got problems<br>
Understand, this is all I ever wanted<br>
Yes, I do it for the fans and I ain't perfect<br>
I've questioned if this life was even worth it<br>
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface<br>
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done<br>
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2: Logic]<br>
This album two but this song was written before the first<br>
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst<br>
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise<br>
But it only makes it that much better when I rise<br>
