<h1>"Run It"</h1><br>

[Verse 1]<br>
Me and my team gotta intervene<br>
What's the point of living if you ain't living a dream?<br>
We live in a world where everybody want everything<br>
Everybody want a better thing<br>
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing<br>
Man, the game been waiting for a better king<br>
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King<br>
Screaming "Money ain't a thing", cause it ain't<br>
Man, I never knew that living out a dream<br>
Meant living out a suitcase, I've been working at a new pace<br>
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute<br>
Not a single second chilling in my new place<br>
Motherfuckers getting two-faced<br>
Cause a brother finally eating<br>
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates<br>
You know I only got two traits<br>
Drop hits, get money—run it<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
What the fuck is there left to talk about<br>
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about<br>
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out<br>
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out<br>
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen<br>
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen<br>
Boy, this been my house, this is merely an addition<br>
Fuck 'em and their permission, they was killin' the game<br>
Who the one that gave 'em remission?—you know the name<br>
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it<br>
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it<br>
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?<br>
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it<br>
I was workin' on a budget, second time around shit is different<br>
Cause they know that boy good, know he does it<br>
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit<br>
Not the people that been hating<br>
They can suck my dick—run it<br>
<br>
[Interlude]<br>
I'ma do somethin' different for the last one<br>
I'ma go in...<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey<br>
On an Interstellar mission in Chicago<br>
At the bottom of the Riviera<br>
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era<br>
I gotta beware of the people<br>
But I take care of the people<br>
When I jump in the cockpit and rock it<br>
Been done had this in my pocket<br>
I had to wait to unlock it<br>
Open that locket and see the picture I painted<br>
No, we ain't never acquainted<br>
On the rise like a defendant<br>
That was charged with possession like an exorcism<br>
My division is solely my vision<br>
God damn, can you feel it?<br>
Uh, I had a dream I would run the game and kill it<br>
Had a dream, can you feel it?<br>
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit<br>
Get up in it, make the shit infinite<br>
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent<br>
I've been at it like an addict<br>
Never at the party like I'm democratic<br>
'Lotta static on the radio<br>
Fuck everything that they represent<br>
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant<br>
No never when I slide up in the spot<br>
Just a youngin' in the game<br>
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back<br>
That was the mentality, never truly reality<br>
Looking for validation<br>
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation<br>
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation<br>
'Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation<br>
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up<br>
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up<br>
Man it's been a good ride up<br>
Everybody want me to lace 'em<br>
I'm too tied up, this a ransom—<br>
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion<br>
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding<br>
Couple years back you ain't give a damn<br>
Autographs off the plane whenever I land<br>
All part of the plan, anything you wanna do you can<br>
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em<br>
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap<br>
Matter fact, you should take a step back—cause I run it<br>
