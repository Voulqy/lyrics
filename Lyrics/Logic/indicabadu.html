<h1>"Indica Badu"</h1><br>

[Intro: Logic]<br>
Yeah, yeah, SlayDro!<br>
This that J Dilla right here<br>
Badu, Indica Badu<br>
Yeah, that's right...<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Logic]<br>
Riding 'round the city with my homies, blowing trees<br>
Wavy like the Seven Seas, living life, let me get it right<br>
Let me give it a minute to get up in it like a beautiful independent woman that's finna make you wait to smash<br>
Come now, let me count this cash<br>
Come now, let me sip this flask<br>
Pockets fat like shawty ass<br>
Jump in the whip, gotta get this gas<br>
Put that shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition<br>
No permission needed, I proceeded to accelerate<br>
Had days with hella hate, but gotta let that anger migrate<br>
All this shit that's on my plate<br>
That food for thought that can't be bought<br>
But only taught, and on the real, know<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<br>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<br>
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier<br>
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it<br>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<br>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<br>
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier<br>
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it<br>
I can't get much higher—<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Nigga, like we smoking all weekend<br>
And I roll and smoke when I'm drinkin'<br>
Tell them open that door but don't peek in<br>
We be havin' a OG Kush meetin'<br>
If we smokin' that dope, it's a reason<br>
Eyes so low from the chiefin'<br>
I be getting high when I wake up<br>
And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping<br>
Man, I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past<br>
It don't even come to my house<br>
If it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag<br>
We roll up the herb and laugh, kick back, blow a zip<br>
Take it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip<br>
Nigga like me always got weed on 'em (got weed on 'em)<br>
Try to tell me that she don't smoke, later on she joinin'<br>
Ain't no point, no I'm back, keep going in<br>
You been rolling with cats, who boring<br>
I be bringing them stacks enormous<br>
Section always in the back important<br>
Bad bitch gorgeous, pack imported<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<br>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<br>
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier<br>
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it<br>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<br>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<br>
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier<br>
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it<br>
I can't get much higher—<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Logic]<br>
Uh, yeah, I'm finna get up in the feeling<br>
Independent feeling like a boss<br>
Roll a little something, smoke a little something<br>
Kick back and then floss<br>
Chiefin' that Indica in the cut, tell my anxiety to get lost<br>
Fuck a pill, only numb the pain<br>
Man, you know how much that shit cost?<br>
I ain't talking 'bout your pocket<br>
No, I am only talking about the mind<br>
When the cannabis combine with the brain<br>
It be like everything you see, it seem to shine<br>
Smoking that Golden State, everything going great<br>
Got a lot on my plate, not a single complaint<br>
Stack of money in the bank<br>
This that RattPack and that Taylor Gang<br>
They know the face and they know the name<br>
I'm a married man with a bad wife<br>
Never fuck around unless it's Mary Jane<br>
Come play the game, honestly never the same<br>
Just like my flow, got one for every occasion<br>
Living the life so my life is amazing, woo<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<br>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<br>
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier<br>
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it<br>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<br>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<br>
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier<br>
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it<br>
I can't get much higher—<br>
<br>
[Outro: Logic]<br>
Yeah, and if you don't know by now—I smoke weed!<br>
"Hahahaha," how Wiz gonna give me the verse<br>
He ain't gonna give me the laugh though?<br>
"Hahahaha," that shit iconic<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Indica Badu<br>
<br><br>
