<h1>"State of Emergency"</h1><br>

[Intro: 2 Chainz]<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
2 Chainz<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]<br>
Okay, I think these niggas is tryin' me<br>
The irony, I used to iron jeans that had the heavy crease<br>
You know my destiny is somewhere over the catastrophe<br>
You know your majesty<br>
You don't smoke strong, that's muscle atrophy<br>
That's such a tragedy<br>
I see murder like it's Master P<br>
Drug dealin' academy, summa cum laude<br>
I made A's, rarely made a B<br>
Watch 1080p, cost 80 apiece<br>
I need 80G, verses ADD (tell 'em)<br>
It was me versus the APD (APD)<br>
'Cause they know I'm ballin' hard like the ACC (sweet)<br>
I ride this beat like an ATV<br>
To see me you need HDTV<br>
Bein' broke is like an allergy<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Logic]<br>
Ballin' with my homies now, everybody know me now<br>
But they don't really know me now<br>
Yeah, this shit is real life<br>
Haters talk shit, but deep down still wonder what it feel like<br>
Yeah, you know I am right, I just signed a 30 million dollar deal<br>
How that feel? Goddamn right, no, that ain't a rapper flex<br>
I just gotta let 'em know<br>
That money don't mean shit without self-respect<br>
Built myself an empire<br>
You can have rap, I'ma set the whole wide world on fire<br>
RattPack, that's a fact<br>
How you go from Bobby Tarantino to the boom bap? It's a trap<br>
Bring it right back, I do it all 'cause I'm like that<br>
You can't put me in a box, my talent put me in the mansion<br>
Rap without Logic, like the game with no expansion<br>
Answer, damn I'm feelin' handsome<br>
I ain't in the club throwin' dollars, I'm at GameStop<br>
'Member used to sell trees on the same block<br>
I went platinum and double platinum then triple platinum<br>
From rappin', I'm snappin', I'm snappin'<br>
They wonder what happened<br>
They was hatin', now they clappin' like, "Yeah, yeah<br>
Bobby got the Grammy this year"<br>
Call me Nostradamus, not cocky, I'm honest, well to be honest<br>
I spit the finest of flows, I count cash, you count hoes<br>
You'll never get, that's why your shit is counterfeit<br>
This that Reasonable Doubt shit, Jay in his prime<br>
This a state of emergency, now sound the alarm<br>
I'm comin' for your neck, but first I'ma slice off the arm<br>
Of anybody who ever try to bite the hand that fed 'em<br>
I'm too powerful, try to double-cross me and I dead 'em<br>
Kill 'em with kindness, you too weak like "7 x 2"<br>
So show some respect when this muscle comes through, woo!<br>
<br><br>
