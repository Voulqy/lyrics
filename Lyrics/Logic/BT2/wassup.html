<h1>"Wassup"</h1><br>

[Chorus: Logic]<br>
I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"<br>
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out<br>
Never know, who's really down or just down and out<br>
Never know, who's really down<br>
I-I-I-I-I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"<br>
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out<br>
Never know, who's really down or just down and out<br>
Never know, who's really down, I-I-I-I-I'm like<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Big Sean]<br>
Bitch, I'm the one, I consistently prove<br>
I stuck to the code like a finishing move (Yeah)<br>
I hit a groove that they can't undo<br>
And over the years all I did was improve<br>
Don Life, toss dice<br>
On on my off night, I left the doubts and now I'm alright<br>
Yeah, I'm a new me, they haven't seen this shit like Vader wearing all white<br>
Like I detonate you, hold it down, I levitate<br>
I like a woman that's all-natural<br>
I give her good energy and let it reciprocate (Yeah, yeah)<br>
A young nigga that's tryna innovate<br>
I been that way since Em and Jay did "Renegade"<br>
You niggas hold up, don't get no closer<br>
I try and told ya, bitch, we the closest<br>
High powers chose us, we never froze up<br>
You lucky if you get to see us close up (Straight)<br>
'Cause people depending on me like (Ugh)<br>
Tryna put a hit out on me, nah (Ugh)<br>
How many times that shit work? None!<br>
So blessed I might just make a whole gospel album (Yeah)<br>
Perform at Sun Daze 'til it's time to rapture<br>
Sean Don and Logic, instant classic<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"<br>
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out<br>
Never know, who's really down or just down and out<br>
Never know, who's really down<br>
I-I-I-I-I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"<br>
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out<br>
Never know, who's really down or just down and out<br>
Never know, who's really down, I-I-I-I-I'm like<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Logic]<br>
I'm finna tell it like it is<br>
Game in a headlock like Stizz<br>
Everybody know the deal, yeah, that boy—he keep it real<br>
Higher than ever with no pill<br>
I just updated my old deal<br>
Told Def Jam no less than 20 mil'—and they cut that shit!<br>
Yeah, I been at it like "Wassup, bitch?"<br>
Put ya favorite rapper deep in a ditch<br>
Ya favorite producer get murdered by 6ix<br>
We touring the world from Japan to The Six<br>
Nah, tryna get paid in full, call me syre like Jaden, fool<br>
Uh, yeah, that's the power of will (Woo!)<br>
Yeah, that's the power I feel!<br>
I got so much in the bank<br>
That I just called my lawyer to work on my will<br>
Hold up, wait a second, chill<br>
Hold up, wait a second, chill<br>
Uh, I mean to Maryland, DC, Virginia<br>
What J. Cole he mean to the 'Ville<br>
Uh, don't do this shit for the thrill<br>
Uh, I am coming for the kill<br>
Tell me how you want it, gotta pedal to the metal<br>
I'm a gunner like a semi-automatic, I'm bringin' the static<br>
I had it, I had to get a unhooked like an addict<br>
And yeah, I'm glad that it went the way it did<br>
Never thought the radio would play the kid<br>
They never care 'til you make it big<br>
Now they say triple platinum<br>
Finger-fuck the people said that never would happen<br>
Came a long way from the trap<br>
Where they was cookin' up crack<br>
I'm still here, RattPack keep it real here<br>
Big boy money, Uncle Phil here<br>
Only "Fresh Prints" in my pocket<br>
I came from nothin', no hater can stop it<br>
Only the illest, you know that I got it<br>
Sean Don and Logic, yeah<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"<br>
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out<br>
Never know, who's really down or just down and out<br>
Never know, who's really down<br>
I-I-I-I-I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"<br>
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out<br>
Never know, who's really down or just down and out<br>
Never know, who's really down, I-I-I-I-I'm like<br>
