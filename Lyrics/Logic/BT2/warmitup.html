<h1>"Warm It Up"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
You—you, you<br>
You—you, you, you, you, you<br>
You, you—you<br>
You—you, you, you, you, you<br>
You—you, you, you, you, you<br>
You, you—you<br>
You—you, you, you, you, you<br>
Warm it up, warm it up<br>
Warm it up, warm it up, warm it up<br>
Warm it up, warm it up<br>
Warm it up, warm it up, warm it up<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Young Sinatra]<br>
It's that Young Sinatra shit, yeah, that's that Young Sinatra shit<br>
Shut the fuck up and listen whenever Young Sinatra spit<br>
Yeah, your girl fine as hell but she a Young Sinatra chick<br>
Hey Bobby, how can you tell? She on the Young Sinatra dick<br>
All these rappers wack as fuck, make the Young Sinatra sick<br>
RattPack be the squad, that's that Young Sinatra clique<br>
Goddamn, said this the Young Sinatra clique, goddamn!<br>
Listen, yeah—I’m visualizing the realism of life in actuality<br>
Step to me, fatality; yeah, this shit is my galaxy<br>
I am who the baddest be, I'd rather be at the academy<br>
Killers, I'm be glad to be me, magnify the shit like bifocal<br>
Motherfuckers talk on the internet, but in person they never vocal<br>
Come to the hood and fuck you up if you prefer to be local<br>
I'm loco from Noho to Soho<br>
Gettin' cheese like a photo, you know, ho<br>
I'm blessed like Sunday, flyer than a runway<br>
Lil' Bobby never second-guessed that he gon' make it one day<br>
One–way or another, my brother, word to your mother<br>
They should give me a badge 'cause I'm always under covers<br>
Goddamn! I'm a miraculous man!<br>
You know I get, I get it, I get it, I get it<br>
The Young Sinatra spit it, rewind it, and rip it<br>
I could murder your whole album with a 30-second snippet<br>
Pass the Mary Jane like I'm runnin' a train with Peter Parker<br>
On tour, I have more sex in the city than Sarah Jessica Parker<br>
The deeper and deeper I go, it get darker<br>
They say they want the old me, they want the Young Sinatra back<br>
The one that murder it, rip it up, no, never givin' up 'round the almanac<br>
Yeah, I'm all of that, fall back, like September again<br>
Baskin' these rappers so hard they won't remember again<br>
When it comes to hip-hop, bitch, I'm indigenous to this<br>
It's apparent I'm bearin' down like a parent<br>
When the beef is at stake, I'm Mastro's<br>
My god-level lyricism surpass flows, I'm much more than fast flows<br>
Money, talk, cash knows, greatest of levels–I've passed those<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Bobby Tarantino]<br>
Fuck that rap shit, this that trap shit (Bobby!)<br>
This world is my contraption (Bobby!)<br>
I was born and raised in the trap, son (Bobby!)<br>
Talk shit, get kidnapped, son (Bobby!)<br>
I don't really know why I rap, son (ay!)<br>
Money in the bank, yeah, I got some (ay!)<br>
Couple sports cars, yeah, I bought some (ay!)<br>
Logic never flex, Bobby get it done! (ay!)<br>
Yeah, y'all don't really know where I come from (come now)<br>
Talkin' that shit, I'ma come for 'em (what's good?)<br>
Tell me what you really know about me right now<br>
Anything I want, I get it somehow<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Young Sinatra]<br>
Fuck that trap shit, this that rap shit<br>
Give me the head like John the Baptist<br>
Ready to rip it, I hope in the captives<br>
Greatest alive like I'm Cassius<br>
I put 'em all in they caskets, they can't seem to get past it<br>
I'm a bastard that mastered the flow<br>
And none of y'all ready for the massacre, though<br>
Fuck with Logic? Yeah, that's a no<br>
Matter of fact, it's not impossible, just highly improbable<br>
Like, saying the police isn't robbable<br>
But I'm liable to walk up in the station in blue-face<br>
Like, "Fuck the police!"—Blue lives ain't a race<br>
Fuck whoever said this rap shit was never a race<br>
This shit a marathon<br>
Murder you motherfuckers and carry on<br>
Claimin' that you really 'bout this shit<br>
You got your Jim Carrey on—<br>
Liar Liar; I might crucify ya<br>
Number one till I die, will never retire<br>
I am the Messiah, I am the god of this shit<br>
This is how we do it—yeah, I started this shit<br>
Yes, I started this shit like–<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Bobby Tarantino]<br>
Fuck that rap shit, this that trap shit (Bobby!)<br>
This world is my contraption (Bobby!)<br>
I was born and raised in the trap, son (Bobby!)<br>
Talk shit, get kidnapped, son (Bobby!)<br>
I don't really know why I rap, son (ay!)<br>
Money in the bank, yeah, I got some (ay!)<br>
Couple sports cars, yeah, I bought some (ay!)<br>
Logic never flex, Bobby get it done! (ay!)<br>
Yeah, y'all don't really know where I come from (come now)<br>
Talkin' that shit, I'ma come for 'em (what's good?)<br>
Tell me what you really know about me right now<br>
Anything I want, I get it somehow<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
You—you, you<br>
You—you, you, you, you, you<br>
You, you—you<br>
You—you, you, you, you, you<br>
You—you, you, you, you, you<br>
You, you—you<br>
You—you, you, you, you, you<br>
<br><br>
