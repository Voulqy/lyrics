<h1>"Midnight"</h1><br>

[Part I]<br>
<br>
[Intro]<br>
Everybody know I be<br>
Everybody know I be<br>
Yeah, yeah...<br>
<br>
[Chorus 1]<br>
Everybody know I be<br>
In the club VIP, sike, not me<br>
Old girl wanna fuck me<br>
Yeah, she fine, I'ma give her that D<br>
Out with the homies, I be sippin' on somethin'<br>
Oh shit, I might need an IV, permanently, permanently<br>
Ayy, Goddamn, these bitches is thirsty<br>
They see a rapper but they ignore the band<br>
I ain't talkin' 'bout musicians, you stupid bitch<br>
Talkin' 'bout what's on my hand<br>
Bitch, I been at and in it for a minute<br>
This all been a part of my plan<br>
Sold millions of records before the radio<br>
Damn, it feel good to be the man<br>
<br>
[Chorus 1]<br>
Ayy, everybody know I be—<br>
In the club VIP, sike, not me<br>
Old girl wanna fuck me<br>
Yeah, she fine, I'ma give her that D<br>
Out with the homies, I be sippin' on somethin'<br>
Oh shit, I might need an IV, permanently, permanently<br>
Goddamn, these bitches is thirsty<br>
They see a rapper but they ignore the band<br>
I ain't talkin' 'bout musicians, you stupid bitch<br>
Talkin' 'bout what's on my hand<br>
Bitch, I been at and in it for a minute<br>
This all been a part of my plan<br>
Sold millions of records before the radio<br>
Damn, it feel good to be the man<br>
<br>
[Chorus 1]<br>
Everybody know I be—<br>
In the club VIP, sike, not me<br>
Old girl wanna fuck me<br>
Yeah, she fine, I'ma give her that D<br>
Out with the homies, I be sippin' on somethin'<br>
Oh shit, I might need an IV, permanently, permanently<br>
<br>
[Part II]<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2]<br>
Oh no Bobby, don't do 'em like that<br>
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that<br>
RattPack the gang, they all on my back<br>
RattPack the gang, we do it like that<br>
No, don't do 'em like that<br>
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that<br>
RattPack the gang, they all on my back<br>
RattPack the gang, we do it like that<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Yeah, uh<br>
The illest that bring it, the realest<br>
Bitch, I came to kill this<br>
They can never bear me, just the homies and me<br>
Now we the Grammy family<br>
You made a couple million, that's it, it's gross<br>
My net is 30, my record clean, my flow is dirty, right?<br>
Real G's move in silence like—<br>
Who the common denominator?<br>
Fuck around and bomb a hater<br>
My flow greater, heart darker than Darth Vader<br>
Check the data, matter of fact, check the state of mind<br>
After I'm finished, these rappers ain't in a state to rhyme<br>
Straight to your mind now<br>
Feel this shit like it's some Braille<br>
Way too heavy for the scale<br>
All I know about is bars, like I couldn't make the bail<br>
It ain't never room to fail<br>
Only growing and prevail<br>
When my anxiety rise and I feel like I'm in hell<br>
Take a moment and inhale<br>
Count to five then exhale<br>
Then we run that motherfucker like a marathon<br>
Hits, motherfucker, hits, yeah we 'bout that Barry Bonds<br>
Brace yourself, you can't retain me<br>
All that shit you talkin' out your mouth just won't sustain me<br>
Logic pickin' up the slack like denim<br>
Spit it with venom<br>
Never pretend to be somethin' that I'm not<br>
And you ain't shit when you stand next to me<br>
No kiddin' like vasectomy<br>
Step to me, throw disrespect to me<br>
And I'll rearrange your trajectory<br>
Black and white like a piano and I'm proud to be<br>
And fuck whoever tell me I am not allowed to be<br>
I am me, I'm a man, can I live?—Goddamn<br>
Yeah, I guess this shit right here is just all a part of the plan<br>
Haters gon' hate, that's the motherfuckin' sayin'<br>
So much plaque up on my wall I need a dentist<br>
From Maryland to Venice, this shit is worldwide<br>
Step up to the mic and it's a homicide<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2]<br>
Oh no Bobby, don't do 'em like that<br>
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that<br>
RattPack the gang, they all on my back<br>
RattPack the gang, we do it like that<br>
No, don't do 'em like that<br>
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that<br>
RattPack the gang, they all on my back<br>
RattPack the gang, we do it like that<br>
<br><br>
