<h1>"BoomTrap Protocol"</h1><br>

[Verse 1]<br>
Let me get up in this bitch, like, "What's good, ho?"<br>
Grippin' this grain, I spit to release the pain<br>
Pimpin' ain't a thang, what's good?<br>
Hold up, let me get it right, I been contemplating life<br>
I been grindin' on a fight, I been writin' on a flight<br>
Roll up on 'em like that Backwood<br>
Better act good or get smacked good<br>
I'm just tryna live life, I'm just tryna get right<br>
Anybody got advice?<br>
I know I'm a workaholic but everybody got a vice<br>
I leave 'em diminished<br>
And I do not know if you know<br>
That I am so ahead of my time<br>
That my whole motherfuckin' discography's already finished<br>
The greatest alive, bitch, I been it<br>
Now go on your business, can I get a witness?<br>
Been smoking and drinking a little bit<br>
There's levels to the litness<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Pull up with that new-new in the driveway<br>
So fresh, I double park that bitch sideways<br>
When it comes to life, I do it my way<br>
Smoked out 180 on the highway<br>
Yeah, I'm sitting shotgun<br>
Gotta let my shawty drive<br>
I'm too alive, leave that pussy crucified<br>
It's just you and I<br>
You know it's do-or-die<br>
It's just you and I<br>
Girl, you know it's do-or-die<br>
(Made this shit right here for any season)<br>
Do-or-die<br>
(Everybody know that it's the reason)<br>
It's do-or-die<br>
(Made this shit right here for any season)<br>
It's do-or-die<br>
(Everybody know that it's the reason)<br>
Yeah, this shit right here do-or-die<br>
(Made this shit right here for any season)<br>
(Everybody know that it's the reason)<br>
It's do-or-die<br>
(Made this shit right here for any season)<br>
(Everybody know that it's the reason)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Hold up, wait a minute, bring it right back<br>
Mix that real with that turn up, call it BoomTrap<br>
I ain't heard no shit like this in so long<br>
I don't know how this right here could go wrong<br>
This is my theme song, me and my team's song<br>
I got millions in the bank because my dream's strong<br>
I don't sip the syrup, I got friends to lean on<br>
But I get my green on, yes, I get my green on<br>
Pull up in this bitch and smoke a O<br>
Like woah, goddamn<br>
Yeah, that boy, he been on the low<br>
About to blow, about to show<br>
About to show 'em, I don't know 'em<br>
I don't know 'em, no, I don't know 'em<br>
I don't know, I don't<br>
I vibe with 'em, I ride with 'em<br>
If they down with me, you know I die with 'em<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Pull up with that new-new in the driveway<br>
So fresh, I double park that bitch sideways<br>
When it comes to life, I do it my way<br>
Smoked out 180 on the highway<br>
Yeah, I'm sitting shotgun<br>
Gotta let my shawty drive<br>
I'm too alive, leave that pussy crucified<br>
It's just you and I<br>
You know it's do-or-die<br>
It's just you and I<br>
Girl, you know it's do-or-die<br>
(Made this shit right here for any season)<br>
Do-or-die<br>
(Everybody know that it's the reason)<br>
It's do-or-die<br>
(Made this shit right here for any season)<br>
It's do-or-die<br>
(Everybody know that it's the reason)<br>
Yeah, this shit right here do-or-die<br>
(Made this shit right here for any season)<br>
(Everybody know that it's the reason)<br>
It's do-or-die<br>
(Made this shit right here for any season)<br>
(Everybody know that it's the reason)<br>
