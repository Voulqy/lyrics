<h1>"Overnight"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Yeah, maybe this should just be the intro, like this<br>
That's it, squad, bitch<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
All these bad bitches say they love me, I already know<br>
Check the- check the bling that's on my finger 'cause I'm married, ho<br>
There he go, everybody know that boy's pockets is swole<br>
What's good? That sound familiar, never been here befo'<br>
Life good, 'cause I just got quoted two hundred a show<br>
Oh no, oh no, two hundred a show<br>
Overnight, all this money that I've been makin', I gave it right back<br>
To all of the people that made me, you know we like that<br>
Don't know why your bitch wanna date me, but I can't fight that<br>
Guess you ain't done shit for her lately, not on the right track<br>
If I think that shit sound good, I gotta write that<br>
Weed man knockin' on the door, I'll be right back<br>
Pass the shit to 6ix, watch him light that<br>
Hit the studio, record the shit, then mix the shit, then master it<br>
And then we do the show and they recite that<br>
Bitch, I'm right back, told 'em 'bout my life, told 'em 'bout my life<br>
Told 'em I was broke as fuck too many nights<br>
Now I see my name up on so many lights, but everybody prolly think this shit done happen–happen–happen<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Overnight, people think this how this shit happened, but they never right<br>
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that<br>
Hustlin' the streets like they trap over–over–overnight<br>
People think this how this shit happened, but they never right<br>
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that<br>
Hustlin' the streets like they trappin' and burnin' (Woo, woo)<br>
<br>
[Bridge 1]<br>
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel<br>
All they ever do is hate the boy, but now they know the name<br>
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel<br>
All they ever do is hate the boy, but now I run the game<br>
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel<br>
You can hate now all you want, but shit won't ever be the same<br>
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel<br>
You can hate me, but I'm not the reason that your life is lame<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Tell me, is it really so hard?<br>
Really so hard, to be a good person?<br>
Tell me, is it really so hard?<br>
Really so hard, to stop acting like a bitch? (Woo!)<br>
I treated everybody with respect and now I'm rich (Woo!)<br>
I treated everybody with respect<br>
Maybe you got issues with your daddy, doe<br>
Maybe you was bullied back in high school<br>
Maybe you are just a tool<br>
<br>
[Bridge 2]<br>
Maybe you're the reason, you're the reason<br>
The reason I don't fuck with nobody, and<br>
Maybe you're the reason, you're the reason<br>
The reason I came up with nobody, and<br>
Maybe you're the reason, you're the reason<br>
Everybody think this right here happened<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Overnight, people think this how this shit happened, but they never right<br>
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that<br>
Hustlin' the streets like they trap over–over–overnight<br>
People think this how this shit happened, but they never right<br>
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that<br>
Hustlin' the streets like they trappin' and burnin' down, shit<br>
