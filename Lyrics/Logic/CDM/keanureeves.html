<h1>"Keanu Reeves"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves<br>
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves<br>
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe<br>
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve<br>
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves<br>
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves<br>
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe<br>
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
At the Garden, sitting courtside, look around like, "Oh my God"<br>
I just sold this motherfucker out, I ain't even try<br>
I ain't one to floss, but I got plaques, run it back<br>
Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back<br>
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint<br>
Played the beat then wrote that joint<br>
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint<br>
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back<br>
6ix made this beat, 6ix bring the heat you got on repeat<br>
Word on the street<br>
Can't no one compete, I'm spectacular<br>
That boy got the sauce on the RAGÚ-lar<br>
I don't play no games 'less we talkin' Fortnite<br>
Finally knew I made it, sittin' at the red light<br>
When them soccer moms pull up in they van while I ride<br>
Like, "Oh my God, children, it's the 1-800 guy"<br>
But my doors suicide, yeah, I'm too alive<br>
Bitch, I have arrived, everybody know I'm one hell of a guy<br>
I ain't tryna fuck your girl, I'm tryna fuck your mama<br>
Fuck the drama, bank account got a extra comma<br>
Yeah, they sweat me like the sauna<br>
Red carpet in my own merch, like that shit is designer<br>
Did you know I'm mixed like Obama?<br>
It ain't a project if Logic ain't talkin' 'bout being biracial<br>
Bicoastal, I'm platinum, go postal, I'm snappin'<br>
Yeah, you know Bobby, but prolly' only know my new shit<br>
That trap shit, that cool shit, but they all know that fool spit<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves<br>
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves<br>
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe<br>
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve<br>
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves<br>
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves<br>
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe<br>
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Yeah, you know you made it when they make a meme for ya<br>
Haters that never made it, I'm livin' the dream for ya<br>
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up<br>
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up<br>
You know what I do, not who coming through<br>
How 'bout you?<br>
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool<br>
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school<br>
I don't give a damn that I'm famous<br>
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous<br>
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps<br>
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance<br>
She said, "No, I don't wanna pay my bills"<br>
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will<br>
This for everybody who ain't made it yet<br>
Got five degrees and six figures in debt<br>
Follow your dreams ho, follow your— follow your—, uh<br>
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny<br>
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?<br>
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me<br>
PLP, I think that is the recipe<br>
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good<br>
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves<br>
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves<br>
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe<br>
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve<br>
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves<br>
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves<br>
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe<br>
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy<br>
