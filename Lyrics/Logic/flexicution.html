<h1>"Flexicution"</h1><br>

[Chorus: Logic]<br>
Yeah<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br>
I'm like...<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Logic]<br>
This-this-this-this-this the type of shit they said they really wanted<br>
So I gave them this right here, now go get blunted<br>
Check my last album, all y'all know I run it<br>
Flipped the script just 'cause I could and fucking stunted<br>
This-this-this-this-this the type of shit my life is all about<br>
Check the Forbes list, you know I'm ballin' out<br>
They say, "Logic, you too humble, boy, just let it out"<br>
Fuck 'em all then, I'ma dead it now<br>
Like oh, I think I know, I think I know<br>
This flow, this super flow, out of control<br>
Like whoa, this shit like whoa, I think I know<br>
Like whoa, like, like whoa, like, like, like...<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Logic]<br>
This that flexicution, this is what the people say they wanted<br>
From the young boy, from the—from the—from the god<br>
This that flexicution, this is what the people say they wanted<br>
From the rap god, from the—from the—from the god<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br>
I'm like...<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Logic]<br>
Hold on, let me bring it back<br>
Everybody know I'm bringing the facts<br>
And they wonder why I got it like that<br>
'Cause I put everything right on the track<br>
And you know I'ma fuck around and let it go<br>
I been living like woah, I been living, you already know<br>
And these motherfuckers wanna take up on every mistake<br>
And I'm showing where I'm going<br>
And I'm knowing what I'm doing, intuition never switching<br>
On a mission, motherfucker, why is you bitching? Why is you bitching?<br>
Like God damn, I'm like (oh God)<br>
Hold up, wait a minute, they ain't ready for the hook<br>
It's another day, another book<br>
I feel like Indiana in Atlanta, hotter than Havana<br>
Coming with the stamina<br>
Bitch, put down your camera, and live in the moment<br>
This shit right here, everybody gon' want it, so what up wit’ it?<br>
Any and everybody talk about the boy changing<br>
Y'all can just shut up wit’ it 'cause I know<br>
Ain't none of y'all getting the flow, boy...<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Logic]<br>
This that flexicution, this is what the people say they wanted<br>
From the young boy, from the—from the—from the god<br>
This that flexicution, this is what the people say they wanted<br>
From the rap god, from the—from the—from the god<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br>
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br>
Everything I do, you know I do it...<br>
<br>
[Outro: Jess Andrea, (John Lindahl) & Logic]<br>
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<br>
It's been a hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)<br>
Hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)<br>
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<br>
That I've been M.I.A, but I was tied up<br>
Till I heard you talking shit, now I'm fired up<br>
5-0 triple 0<br>
