<h1>"Lord Willin'"</h1><br>

[Verse 1]<br>
Okay now, this how I'm feeling, lately I'm like the villain<br>
Cause while they on that other shit<br>
I been posted, out here chillin'<br>
Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5<br>
You know this that shit that you bumpin'<br>
In your whip while you drive<br>
I've been living life and I hope that you do the same<br>
Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame<br>
Come on I've been through the game<br>
'Bout time that they know my name<br>
Numb it down for the pain, this music my Novocaine<br>
Lord willin' we overcame, it's time to get over man<br>
I've been around the world and back<br>
And I swear it's all the same<br>
And what I learned; a prophet don't do it for the profit<br>
Gon' get off it, check the topic<br>
Watch me drop it, can you top it?<br>
I don't know I've been at it on the low<br>
Never did it like this here before<br>
But I'm still here and I just hope<br>
I'll make a difference, make a killin', Lord willin'<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Lord willin', make a difference<br>
Lord willin'—uh, Lord willin'<br>
I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<br>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<br>
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<br>
I don't understand what's happening<br>
And so I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<br>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<br>
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<br>
I don't understand what's happening<br>
So I tell em—<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I guess I'm back at it; I ain't done, I ain't had it<br>
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic<br>
For this rap shit I'm an addict, but can't fuck with that dramatic<br>
I've been busting my ass, they probably think it's automatic<br>
Yes sir, I've done this shit before<br>
Like your baby momma momma<br>
I'ma tell 'em like it is, I'ma tell 'em like it is<br>
Life ain't picture perfect, we use the negatives to develop<br>
I'm well up, I'm way up<br>
Nothing but net, fuck the layup, I'm way up<br>
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions<br>
Can't fuck with they delusions, I'm on that 101 cruisin'<br>
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way<br>
But no not quite like this, living like that<br>
In a way, guess you could say made me wanna write like this<br>
Not quite like this, on my level, I'm unique and I'm a rebel<br>
Like you listening? I hope that you're listening<br>
This feel like it's summertime; waiting for the bus<br>
Number nine, through the city all alone<br>
Not a worry, not your phone<br>
We just vibing, maybe flying 'round the world<br>
Man, I hope you see the world<br>
And all your dreams will unfurl<br>
Just don't never cash your pearl<br>
Go out there and make a livin', take this advice that I'm givin'<br>
Make a difference, make a killin', make a killin', Lord willin'<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Lord willin', make a difference<br>
Lord willin', Lord willin'<br>
I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<br>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<br>
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<br>
I don't understand what's happening<br>
And so I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<br>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<br>
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<br>
I don't understand what's happening<br>
So I tell em—<br>
