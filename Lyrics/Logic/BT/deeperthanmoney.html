<h1>"Deeper Than Money"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
People want to talk about what makes them happy<br>
What really makes you happy?<br>
Tell me what makes you happy<br>
Makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you glad<br>
Tell me what makes you happy<br>
People say its money, give me the money<br>
All the money (money)<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
If I could live forever and a day<br>
Know I'd never fade away<br>
But my life is not okay, I...<br>
I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed<br>
Life is fucking up my vibe, I...<br>
I wish had a lot of money<br>
Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper, you already know<br>
My life would be so much better with cheddar<br>
Only work as hard as I do for vendetta<br>
Cause my ninth grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit<br>
Wouldn't be nothing, working that minimum wage<br>
And cooking McMuffins, so I'm puffing on this green<br>
Wishing I had more money than I do<br>
Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, ah!<br>
And so I'm all about my business<br>
Is there anyone who wit this?<br>
Can a brother get a witness like: Ah—Ooh, Ah—Ooh<br>
Wassup with it, come and get it<br>
Tell me now what's on your mind<br>
I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline<br>
Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine<br>
Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line<br>
Somebody tell me now what done happen to society<br>
My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety<br>
They say that money cannot make you happy<br>
Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke<br>
And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?<br>
Why you trying me, like ah...<br>
<br>
[Interlude]<br>
Now I'mma tell 'em what makes me happy<br>
This what makes me happy, right here<br>
Like this...<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Jump up on that MPC, like a boss MVP<br>
Cook up shit that make other producers wanna envy me<br>
Master it then set it free, turn it into MP3s<br>
Spin that shit up in Serato, I can feel the energy<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
This shit is deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
Deeper, deeper than money<br>
This shit is deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
You know its deeper, deeper honey<br>
This shit is deeper than money<br>
Deeper than your money<br>
My money, they money, everybody money<br>
Said, this shit is deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
It's deeper than money<br>
<br>
[Break]<br>
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself<br>
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself<br>
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself<br>
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself<br>
Think I need to focus more on my health<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
I do, I do—this the shit that I love<br>
This the shit that I love<br>
Comes straight from above<br>
Off the top off the dome<br>
Gotta get it, go home<br>
Hella late, feeling good, got a lot on my plate<br>
What the fuck is on my mind?<br>
I just, I just want to rhyme<br>
This the type of shit I got to do<br>
Oh my God, what's the time?<br>
Can you feel it right now?<br>
Can you feel the whole style?<br>
It's the type of shit, I gotta get it, gotta get it<br>
I've been vibing out here in Malibu<br>
Would you come through?<br>
Tell me motherfucker truly what it do?<br>
L-O-G-I-C, this is who I be<br>
L.A. where I'm at, M.D. what I be<br>
All that, all that<br>
God, I can feel it, I can feel it<br>
I'm a fly on the wall feeling ten feet tall<br>
Right now this the type of shit, this the style<br>
This the motherfucking style<br>
And so I tell em...<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
This shit is deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
Deeper, deeper than money<br>
This shit is deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
You know its deeper, deeper honey<br>
This shit is deeper than money<br>
Deeper than your money<br>
My money, they money, everybody money<br>
Said, this shit is deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
Deeper than money<br>
It's deeper than money<br>
