<h1>"Wrist"</h1><br>

[Chorus: Logic]<br>
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist<br>
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br>
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist<br>
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br>
Yeah, I've been, yeah I've been killin' this, killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've been flickin' that, flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've been killin' this, cookin' that<br>
Killin' this, flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've hard in the paint, not a single assist<br>
Yeah, I've flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Logic & (Pusha T)]<br>
Let me tell you 'bout the young man<br>
Matter of fact, I'ma let Push tell that<br>
Tell you 'bout the old man<br>
Had a change of heart and then fell back<br>
Old man lived a long life<br>
Walked around with a long knife<br>
You ain't cut the white like Jesus<br>
That Colombiana, that's mi hermanos (YUGH)<br>
Look at the flick of that wrist<br>
I'm feelin' like Leonardo<br>
Let me paint a picture, I might need a bottle<br>
On the road to success, I could feel the throttle<br>
That Michelangelo, hundreds in the envelope<br>
Tight shit when I write shit<br>
And that old man had a change of heart<br>
Wish he knew it back from the start like goddamn<br>
Looked around, seen his wife on the ground<br>
Military bussin' bullets all over the whole compound<br>
Soon as he seen it, I swear it, I mean it, my members go quicker than vamonos<br>
He dead, she dead, he in jail<br>
Everyone fallin' like dominoes<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist<br>
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br>
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist<br>
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br>
Yeah, I've been, yeah I've been killin' this, killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've been flickin' that, flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've been killin' this, cookin' that<br>
Killin' this, flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've hard in the paint, not a single assist<br>
Yeah, I've flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Pusha T]<br>
Simple logic<br>
Clockwise, counterclockwise, realest nigga in the top five<br>
Other four ain't rap niggas, I'm just reppin' for the blow side<br>
Yuugh, that's coastlines, Panama for the boat rides<br>
Worth billions, and we ain't even need Showtime<br>
Just money counters and kitchenwear<br>
Condo with a bitch in there<br>
Two scales and baggies, we got rich in there, woo!<br>
The Rollie's been the trophy since Hawaiian Sophie<br>
Curry over Kobe, we shootin' niggas<br>
Splash brothers with the coca, add in baking soda<br>
Goodfellas to my niggas (Yuugh) all Ray Liottas<br>
Shades of blue, I aim at you<br>
Let the sky fall, let it rain on you<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist<br>
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br>
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist<br>
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br>
Yeah, I've been, yeah I've been killin' this, killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've been flickin' that, flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've been killin' this, cookin' that<br>
Killin' this, flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I've hard in the paint, not a single assist<br>
Yeah, I've flickin' that wrist<br>
Yeah, I've cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br>
