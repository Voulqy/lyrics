<h1>"44 Bars"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
If you're dealing war, backwards stay far<br>
We're dealing with truths and rights<br>
Come some more into my sight<br>
(You no hear me yet?)<br>
(Hear me live and direct)<br>
(Walk with your tap)<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Yeah, in London talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit<br>
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit<br>
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged<br>
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same<br>
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome<br>
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm<br>
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation<br>
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and<br>
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement<br>
It ain't about the money and notoriety<br>
It's about the people and making a difference in society<br>
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie<br>
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi<br>
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?<br>
Same level, the same rebel that never settled<br>
Pullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto<br>
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered<br>
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances<br>
I used to spend all my time conversing with you<br>
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you<br>
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet<br>
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street<br>
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside<br>
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide<br>
That misconception, "'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"<br>
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied<br>
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"<br>
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit<br>
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label<br>
Within six months I put the second one on they table<br>
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce<br>
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce<br>
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce<br>
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce<br>
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand<br>
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand<br>
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand<br>
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand<br>
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit<br>
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit<br>
Thank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask<br>
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass<br>
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?<br>
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Come some more into my sight...<br>
