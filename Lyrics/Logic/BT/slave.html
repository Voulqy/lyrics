<h1>"Slave"</h1><br>

[Refrain]<br>
Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-ey-oh<br>
Hey-oh, hey, that hey-oh, hey-oh, hey<br>
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)<br>
Hey-oh (Alright)<br>
Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey (Alright, let's go)<br>
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this<br>
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this<br>
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this<br>
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights<br>
No lights, all for this<br>
Tell me what you know about sleeping outside<br>
No ride in the wintertime, all for this<br>
Tell me what you know about commas in the bank<br>
Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this<br>
Tell me what you know about family never there<br>
But swear they deserve all of this<br>
Tell me what you know about people tryna test you<br>
Don't wanna get involved with this<br>
X you out, you get solved with this<br>
Everybody gotta evolve with this<br>
Like bitch I bet I be at the place I said I'd be<br>
Legendary like No I.D<br>
You know I be duckin' every ho I see<br>
Cause I'm out of this world, and I know I be like...<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this<br>
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this<br>
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this<br>
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Living as a black man, in the skin of the white man<br>
Everybody wanna fight man, and I put it on my right hand<br>
Goddamn, it's all for this<br>
I just wanna make the world a better place<br>
Fuck race and the shade in my face<br>
Looking for the sun but the shade in my face<br>
Best in my field, I'm a slave to the race<br>
Black motherfucker, white motherfucker<br>
I don't give a damn what you is, can you write motherfucker?<br>
Said I couldn't do it, said I wouldn't do it<br>
I just made a million in a month, aight motherfucker?<br>
I did everything I said I'd ever do and to you I still ain't shit?<br>
Aight motherfucker<br>
Runnin' around the world yelling P-L-P<br>
But as a last resort, we gon' fight motherfucker like<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this<br>
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this<br>
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this<br>
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-ey-oh<br>
Hey-oh, hey, that hey-oh, hey-oh, hey<br>
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)<br>
Hey-oh (Alright)<br>
