<h1>"The Jam"</h1><br>

[Intro: KRS-ONE]<br>
Buck, buck, buck, buck, booyakasha!<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Sellin' records on a major label<br>
But I'm still movin' like I'm independent<br>
Still respected like I'm in the pen and<br>
I'm just talkin' my shit so don't get offended<br>
Bitch I been invented this real<br>
Been the same since my deal<br>
If you try to say that I'm changin'<br>
Wait for the album, see how you feel<br>
My third album my Graduation, like Kanye<br>
Music on another level<br>
Yeah, I'm tryna take this shit further beyond 'Ye<br>
I just might fuck around and drop this shit on 'em by surprise<br>
Like I'm Beyoncé<br>
Got a couple million in the bank right now<br>
But I want my zeros beyond Jay<br>
Counting money like Rothenberg PC<br>
Paid a price to be me, ain't it nice to be me?<br>
Ain't it nice to be free?<br>
Do what you want when you wanna do it<br>
On the real, it ain't nothin' to it<br>
Young man on his Alan Watts<br>
In a bookstore with my pocket watch<br>
Wifey, goin' hard with the squats<br>
Life good so they take shots<br>
That's childish, I hate shots<br>
I've been at it, Rattpack, get that shit tatted<br>
Fuck with me on Snapchat<br>
Talk shit and get clapped back<br>
Only carry-on is my backpack<br>
When I jetset like a war vet, what up?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Everybody know I've been at it with this rap shit<br>
Fuck around with this trap shit<br>
But this next album is a wrap, shit<br>
My third album my Graduation, like Kanye<br>
Music on another level<br>
Yeah, I'm tryna take this shit further beyond 'Ye<br>
I just might fuck around and drop this shit on 'em by surprise<br>
Like I'm Beyoncé<br>
Got a couple million in the bank right now<br>
But I want my zeros beyond Jay<br>
I want my zeros beyond, I want my zeros beyond Jay<br>
That shit they talkin' beyond fake<br>
Fact I’m here right now beyond fate, uh<br>
I'ma take a minute and get in it so you know I'm in it<br>
This right here my house, you the tenant<br>
Everything that happens, I intend it<br>
Every word that you hear, I invented<br>
I've been living like a king, I ain't worried 'bout a thing<br>
I just been bumpin' that Destroyer "Girl in a Sling"<br>
That's the type of shit I bring<br>
I'm doin' this for the fans<br>
So they can turn up in my absence<br>
Started a channel<br>
Already made a hundred grand off of AdSense<br>
I ain't do it for the money though<br>
I don't do it for the money though<br>
Shout out to Kid Cudi though<br>
That's the homie, you already know<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
I don't give a damn, I know who I am, tell 'em<br>
I don't give a damn, I know who I am<br>
Yeah they talkin', but I'm gettin' money for me and my fam<br>
This shit ain't that super deep, nah, this right here just the jam<br>
This right here the jam<br>
This right here just the jam<br>
This shit right here jam, this my jam<br>
This shit here the jam<br>
