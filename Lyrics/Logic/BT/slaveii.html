<h1>"Slave II"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
East side, west side, we ride, we die, everyone knows<br>
Everyone knows, everyone knows<br>
East side, west side, we ride, we die, everyone knows<br>
Everyone knows, everyone knows<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights<br>
No lights, all for this<br>
Tell me what you know about sleeping outside<br>
No ride in the wintertime, all for this<br>
Tell me what you know about commas in the bank<br>
Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this<br>
X you out, you get solved with this<br>
Everybody know I...<br>
<br>
[Interlude]<br>
I'm a slave<br>
I'm a slave<br>
You a slave (Yeah)<br>
You a slave (Alright)<br>
I'm a slave for this shit<br>
I'm a slave (Yeah)<br>
You a slave (Alright)<br>
I'm a slave<br>
You got to slave for this shit<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Walk inside of Def Jam<br>
Step on the president table and dap 'em up with the left hand<br>
'Cause I'm countin' money with the right<br>
In a different city every night<br>
And I'm sellin' records like it's white<br>
It's another day, another flight<br>
Paris in the morning, L.A. at night<br>
What a beautiful sight<br>
Now tell me who be fuckin' with me, alright?<br>
Everybody know I'm livin' this life<br>
Everyone know I got the baddest wife<br>
This shit right here, everybody gonna like<br>
Hold up, I know what I, know what I like<br>
Tell me why everybody in the pipe<br>
'Cause I'm the only one doin' it right<br>
I'm a rap genius like Rob Markman<br>
Spent a couple of million on my new apartment<br>
Down in Manhattan, that's a multi-million dollar view<br>
And I got it from rappin'<br>
Damn everyone nappin' on the boy, heh, shit<br>
I'm not a mad rapper, but what?<br>
I'm angrier than Kanye<br>
Angrier than Kanye when he talkin' about clothes<br>
That's a fashion line<br>
And my last album went number one<br>
So what that mean?<br>
I did better than you, you, you<br>
Sold way more than that pop bitch<br>
And I dare Def Jam to drop this<br>
I just drop hits<br>
Check the Instagram fam<br>
I got fifty-thousand people in the crowd, singin' out loud<br>
Every word, that's every lyric<br>
You can hate, shit, just stop actin' like you don't hear it<br>
This shit right here for the party<br>
That album that comin', that's shit for the spirit, woo!<br>
<br>
