[Ad-Libs]<br>

[Intro]<br>
All day (All day), everyday (Everyday)<br>
We was on that block until we made a way (We made a way)<br>
Day to day, man that's the only way (Only way)<br>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away<br>
They gon' know my name until it fade—<br>
(Way, way, way), uh, fade away<br>
Uh, they gon' know my name until it fade away<br>
(Okay, okay)<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that<br>
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back<br>
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kin, gotta get my son back<br>
Cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you (you, you, you)<br>
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday<br>
Driving to work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day<br>
I know, I'ma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce<br>
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit<br>
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah<br>
Yes I'ma die but I don’t wonder why in the hell I'ma ride in the dead of it, yeah<br>
I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable<br>
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away<br>
They gon' know my name until it fade a— uh<br>
(Way, way, way), fade away<br>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br>
(Yeah, yeah)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Tell me what I wouldn't wanna give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this<br>
Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this<br>
I might just, might just, I don't know<br>
Reinvention, that's my intention<br>
Want so much more than this third-dimension<br>
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture<br>
No metaphor, I’m being real with ya<br>
But it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"<br>
Going HAM, full of all of them<br>
In a spaceship, I’m in another system<br>
So futuristic, on another mission<br>
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen<br>
Livin' my life—no inhibition, life to death with no intermission<br>
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain<br>
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame<br>
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer<br>
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya<br>
Sit back and really get the picture<br>
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away<br>
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away<br>
<br>
[Chorus (Extended)]<br>
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away<br>
They gon' know my name until it fade—<br>
(Way, way, way), fade away<br>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br>
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away<br>
They gon' know my name until it fade—<br>
(Way, way, way), fade away<br>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br>
<br>
[Skit: QUENTIN THOMAS (Steven Blum), WILLIAM KAI (Kevin Randolph) & THALIA (Anna Elyse Palchikoff)]<br>
THOMAS: Get the upgrade?<br>
KAI: Nah, man. It’s the same shit with a different title!<br>
THALIA: That’s not true, Kai<br>
KAI: What the fuck?!<br>
THOMAS: Yeah, man. They didn’t just upgrade features, they enhanced her A.I<br>
KAI: So she can actually hold a conversation?<br>
THOMAS: Yeah. Ask her yourself<br>
KAI: Uh, what am I thinking, Thalia?<br>
THALIA: Kai, I’m a program in the ship’s interface, not a psychic<br>
KAI: Damn, girl!<br>
THOMAS: Yeah, that’s another thing now. She’s unisex<br>
KAI: What?!<br>
THOMAS: Thalia, integrate Y chromosome feature<br>
THALIA: Sure thing, Thomas. Would you like a standard accent or something a little more exotic?<br>
KAI: Holy shit!<br>
THOMAS: Told you, man. The upgrade’s crazy. Thalia, revert last command and run simulation<br>
THALIA: Running simulation<br>
KAI: Man, what the hell is that?<br>
THOMAS: Well, you can pick anyone in history, and based off a collection of data, it allows you to personally speak with them<br>
KAI: Anybody?<br>
THOMAS: Anybody<br>
KAI: Thalia, do Big Sean<br>
THOMAS: All right, let me get this straight. You can speak with anyone in recorded history, like Jesus, Steve Jobs, Einstein, and you pick Big Sean?<br>
KAI: Man, fuck yeah! That’s my dog!<br>
THOMAS: *Laughs* Okay. Thalia, simulate Big Sean<br>
THALIA: What up Kai, you lil' bitch?<br>
KAI: Yeah, I'ma have to upgrade my shit<br>
