<h1>"Upgrade"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Aye, let me just rap...<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I've upgraded while they've waited<br>
Will they love it?, Will they hate it?<br>
Never faded I evade it<br>
Cause I never really want to complicate it<br>
Think I've made it, yes I did<br>
I'm giving them bars like a bid<br>
Let me rewind it like a vid<br>
"Did he just say that?" Yes, I did<br>
And they really wanna get it like I live<br>
God damn mother fucker what I gotta give<br>
Way back in DC, at Liv<br>
On the way to that everlasting life<br>
Will they rob you? Yeah, they might<br>
Hold up, wait a minute, veer to the right<br>
On this road to success, I've faced my fears<br>
Then hop on that flight<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
I've upgraded<br>
I've upgraded<br>
I've upgraded<br>
I've upgraded<br>
I've upgraded<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
My bitch bad got a sick figure<br>
Play 1 show and get 6 figures<br>
We build bigger, money tall as a mountain, bitch<br>
I've got Hilfigers, like goddamn<br>
Yes sir, I know who I am<br>
I'm that main man Martin, out here kicking out Pam<br>
Just riding 'round with my Gina in that all-black Beamer<br>
All the way from Maryland whipping out West Covina<br>
Hold up, now check my demeanor<br>
Yeah, your girl bad, my girl meaner<br>
I've upgraded<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I've got the Akira on the wall<br>
I just can't follow their law<br>
Swear to God that they know me<br>
They don't know me at all<br>
And its all right, it's alright<br>
I've upgraded<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Let me bring in them new kicks like Timbaland<br>
I gotta reboot with this upgrade<br>
My metaphors on Cloud 9<br>
And the meaning behind them is so vague<br>
Before I created this universe<br>
I had to fly through the Bermuda first<br>
6ix on the beat, then we queue the verse<br>
Now I'm in another world when the flow emerge<br>
Feel like I'm in a Fifth Element<br>
I'm in my element lost in paradise<br>
Its me, you and Leeloo, Korben Dallas in Fhloston Paradise<br>
Never by chance like a pair of dice<br>
I don't give a fuck about their advice<br>
I'm on another planet, no I'm not manic<br>
Bitch I'm decompressed, know they can't stand it<br>
Cause I pilot it and manned it the best<br>
All they demanded was I gave up and laid that dream to rest<br>
(God damn!) Hold up, wait a minute; fuck all that shit<br>
I left Earth ages ago to avoid and duck all that shit<br>
You know when we on<br>
Making music that's gon' survive for eons<br>
Bloodshed from America to Sierra Leone<br>
That's that shit I can't be on, that's the reason I be gone<br>
Yes, I keep it professional like Luc Besson and Leon<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
I've upgraded<br>
I've upgraded<br>
I've upgraded<br>
I've upgraded<br>
I've upgraded<br>
