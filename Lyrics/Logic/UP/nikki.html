<h1>"Nikki"</h1><br>

[Verse]<br>
I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins<br>
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain<br>
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you<br>
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you<br>
Maybe I'm just not as strong as I once was<br>
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz<br>
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)<br>
Nikki baby, I love you but now I gotta go<br>
'Cause in the end what happens you already know<br>
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low<br>
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)<br>
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that<br>
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back<br>
Even though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)<br>
Tell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)<br>
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary<br>
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing<br>
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy<br>
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me<br>
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first<br>
Me and you together, swear to God that's all that worked<br>
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)<br>
Uh, my heart is hard at work<br>
We been together like ten years<br>
Goddamn, took me as young man<br>
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go<br>
What will they write upon my grave?<br>
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave<br>
But everything he gave her was for nothing though<br>
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go<br>
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas<br>
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous<br>
All I know is I'm living the life I never would<br>
Finally let you go, I thought I never could<br>
Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared<br>
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there<br>
Tried to run but my legs won't<br>
I look away but my head don't<br>
I love it when you're fresh<br>
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath<br>
I hate it that I need you, Nikki<br>
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki<br>
I hate that I bleed for you<br>
Uh, I long and I need for you<br>
But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)<br>
Nothing can replace you (Replace you)<br>
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go<br>
But you're everywhere I long to be<br>
And all these other people that don't seem to understand<br>
I'm just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me<br>
Man you're everything I crave<br>
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave<br>
I'm a king, you're my Coretta<br>
But lately, I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)<br>
<br>
[Break]<br>
Slave for the—<br>
Said, I'm a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)<br>
Been a slave for ya<br>
I'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya<br>
Slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)<br>
Nikki, Nikki, slave for ya<br>
I'm a slave for ya Nikki<br>
I'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya<br>
<br>
