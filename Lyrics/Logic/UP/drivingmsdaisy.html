<h1>"Driving Ms. Daisy"</h1><br>

[Verse 1: Logic]<br>
Somewhere this shit done got crazy<br>
I've just been drivin' Ms. Daisy<br>
With my hands on the steering wheel<br>
And my eyes on the pavement<br>
I give a fuck 'bout where they went<br>
I owe my lawyer a payment<br>
They talkin' 'bout no arraignment<br>
Now I wonder where the rain went<br>
I just been all in my mind, homies tell me I'm stressin'<br>
I been countin' what's on my bucket list<br>
And not on my blessings<br>
I think it's time for a lesson, hold up (Hold up), you better pay attention<br>
I-I-I can't end up like my mama poppin' anti-depressants<br>
My therapist think I'm crazy (Uh, yeah, yeah-yeah)<br>
Well, shit, she probably does (Aw yeah!)<br>
All that stress I'm under, I wonder why I don't do drugs (I don't do drugs, yeah)<br>
Raised in a household full of killers and thugs (Uh, uh, uh)<br>
Shit, I've been in doubt so long, don't know who I was<br>
But I know who I am (Know who I am)<br>
Yes, I know who I is (Know who I is)<br>
Please pardon my grammar, Daisy vibin' with this<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic & Childish Gambino]<br>
I've just been drivin'<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, da-da-da, la-da-da-da<br>
I've just been drivin'<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, da-da-da, la-da-da-da<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da (Yeah)<br>
I've just been drivin' Miss Daisy<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da (Yeah)<br>
I've just been drivin' Miss Daisy<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da (Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]<br>
That Bino the realest (Uh)<br>
This beat made me kill it (Uh)<br>
Her feet to the ceiling, she said that she love me<br>
She never said that in college, 3005 is our mileage<br>
I'm in my lane like a Prius, because I'm movin' in silence<br>
You still ain't broke down yet? (Yeah)<br>
All the flashing lights and a couple Crown Vic's<br>
Wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left<br>
Tell your nigga speed up, she don't wanna get left<br>
Relationships look closer in that rear view<br>
Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you<br>
So now you gotta stop (Stop), park (Park)<br>
Put that shit in neutral<br>
Yeah, you really love her, but is she worth yo' future?<br>
Your Ciara, your Beyoncé, they be sayin' he got money<br>
Think that Kim be wit Kanye if he left drive in the driveway?<br>
Yeah, I know who you are, yeah, I know who you is<br>
We were drivin' together, when we met we were kids<br>
You ain't know 'bout the biz, I ain't know 'bout it either<br>
I see you in that new ride, I flash my lights when I see you<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic & Childish Gambino]<br>
I just be drivin'<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, da-da-da, la-da-da-da (Yeah, uh, yeah)<br>
I just been drivin' (Yeah)<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, da-da-da, la-da-da-da<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy<br>
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da (Yeah-yeah, you)<br>
<br>
[Outro: Logic]<br>
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, da-da<br>
Turn left on West Deer Park<br>
Doing 90 on the highway<br>
We gon' do it my way<br>
I said, 90 on the highway, we gon' do it my way<br>
Uh, I said, 90 on the high, 90 on the high, ah-da-da<br>
90 on the high, 90 on the high, ah-da-da<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy (Yeah, uh, you-you, uh-uh, yeah, yeah-yeah)<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy (You-you, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, uh, you-you, aw yeah! Uh-uh, you, you, you)<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy (Yeah, you-you, uh yeah, uh yeah-yeah)<br>
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy (You-you, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, uh, you-you, aw yeah! You-you, you-you, yeah-yeah)<br>
