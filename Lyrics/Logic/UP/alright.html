<h1>"Alright"</h1><br>

[Chorus: Logic]<br>
Hold up<br>
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right, yeah<br>
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right<br>
You know everything is alright<br>
You know everything is al-<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Logic]<br>
Just ride with a mothafucka<br>
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucka, hold me down<br>
Chillin', In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, rockin' Adidas<br>
With a señorita when she sippin' liquor by the liter<br>
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino<br>
He know we be in the casino, lightin' Cubans with a C-note<br>
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido<br>
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito<br>
Whenever I step on the beat, ho<br>
Like a killer on the creep slow<br>
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho<br>
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though, uh<br>
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off<br>
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with a sawed-off<br>
Blowin' up like a Molotov<br>
This is war, everybody, ain't no reason I'ma call it off<br>
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright<br>
In the studio every day<br>
So you know this shit about to be a busy night<br>
Everything is al-, everything is alright<br>
<br>
[Interlude: Big Sean]<br>
It's Finally Famous over everything<br>
RattPack gang<br>
What up though, Logic? Yeah<br>
Day one shit right there<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic & Big Sean]<br>
Hold up<br>
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right, yeah<br>
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right<br>
You know everything is alright (Sean Don)<br>
You know everything is al-<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Big Sean]<br>
Oh my God, they plottin' and schemin'<br>
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'<br>
They tryna take my blessings away<br>
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed every day<br>
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well<br>
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'<br>
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy<br>
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'<br>
Got Champagne problems, and I order more<br>
My wardrobe is Aura Gold<br>
I'm a young nigga with a older soul<br>
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more<br>
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician (Good, yeah)<br>
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician (Good)<br>
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up (Uh-huh)<br>
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap-dap me up<br>
Hype nigga, back-back-back it up (Whoa)<br>
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop (Stop)<br>
That's the type of shit I boycott<br>
Yellin' fuck the 5-0, state troops<br>
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts<br>
I got these good girls hoin' out<br>
Tell me what the fuck you know about (What?)<br>
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about<br>
Then they throw you in the game<br>
And you mothafuckin' blow it out<br>
Now everything is alright<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
Hold up<br>
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right, yeah<br>
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right<br>
You know everything is alright (Yeah)<br>
You know everything is al- (Uh, yeah)<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Logic]<br>
Whippin' through Gotham<br>
Hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off 'em<br>
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin<br>
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane<br>
Nobody knowin' my pain<br>
But I be killin' 'cause I'm into the game<br>
Now lookin' back, it's like ain't nothin' the same<br>
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novella<br>
Hit you with a Beretta, get you wetter than a umbrella<br>
Ain't nobody better do it like me<br>
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me, prolly wanna fight me<br>
But I just keep the peace, no need to keep a piece<br>
I keep my enemies on a leash, capiche?<br>
And keep it real for the people I reach<br>
<br><br>
