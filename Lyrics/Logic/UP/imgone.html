<h1>"I'm Gone"</h1><br>

[Verse 1]<br>
Living life like this is so crazy, this world is amazing<br>
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby<br>
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh<br>
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound<br>
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here<br>
Don't fuck around cause they kill here<br>
This music, it kill fear<br>
I use it, when I need to hear<br>
Been there, done that<br>
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back<br>
Simple shit, man I'm done with that<br>
Fake rap, take it back<br>
My chain heavy, got a lot of money<br>
My bitch bad, have fun with that<br>
I've been there and don't want it back<br>
If I see the bitch I might run it back<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Cause I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long<br>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone<br>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<br>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
So what now? (So what now?)<br>
Let's get down—let's get drowned, on this vision<br>
My division is the greatest that's around<br>
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)<br>
This is where I'ma be for as long as I'm alive<br>
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this<br>
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this<br>
They say "what's your motivation?"<br>
Cutting these records like back in the basement<br>
Boy, fuck a vacation<br>
We do this for love, not no validation<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing<br>
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby<br>
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh<br>
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long<br>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone<br>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<br>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Wanna get it like this<br>
(I think so) when I'm driving<br>
(I drink slow) when I'm vibing<br>
(You never know, know, know, know) (Lets go!)<br>
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic<br>
I don't smoke but she love to smoke<br>
And look good as fuck when she light it<br>
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it<br>
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it<br>
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know<br>
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?<br>
Shit girl I know that you want it—but fuck all that<br>
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around<br>
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me<br>
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone<br>
That's the type of shit that I'm on<br>
Grip the mic and I go (Whoo!)<br>
Fuck around with this flow (I know)<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing<br>
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby<br>
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh<br>
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long<br>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone<br>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<br>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<br>
<br>
[Outro: Thalia]<br>
Making a single before your album is like putting together a trailer for a movie you have yet to shoot<br>
