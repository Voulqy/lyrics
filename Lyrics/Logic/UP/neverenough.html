<h1>"Never Enough"</h1><br>

[Pre-Hook]<br>
When that liquor get po’ up<br>
And that green get roll up<br>
When them sets get throwed up<br>
I’m like nah man, hol’ up<br>
Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff<br>
Better hope they don’t call my bluff<br>
Cause my mind is going crazy<br>
This shit is never enough<br>

[Post-Hook: Woman]<br>
Not even, not even, not even, not enough<br>
Not even, not even, not even, not enough<br>
Not even, not even, not even, not enough<br>
Not even, not even, not even, not enough<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit<br>
At the party with my homies, walk up and they play my shit<br>
On the road, tickets sold, didn’t have to sell my soul<br>
Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal<br>
Where you stay, every day, just got my crib in LA<br>
Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ<br>
Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh<br>
Bitches on my dick, don’t give a fuck, y’all must not know what’s up<br>
In the cut, we don’t give a fuck, we just trying to cut<br>
Line em up, if they say they bout it then we’ll sign em up<br>
Rattpack, that’s a fact, basic bitch can’t fuck with that<br>
Where you at? That’s what they be asking, I say on the map<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Who we are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet<br>
Drop that new shit just cause they demand it<br>
Living like we got it cause we get it<br>
Do it just to say we fucking did it<br>
