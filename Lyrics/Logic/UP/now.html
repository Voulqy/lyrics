Blowin' up like a war vet<br>
Goddamn, everybody wonder who I am<br>
'Cause I came out the cut like a stitch in your hand<br>
And, my music flowing through your city like drug money<br>
Made a mill' off rap, fuck drug money<br>

Say I've got 'em when I hit rock bottom and get up again<br>
Sippin' gin, now would you pick up the pen<br>
If I was locked up in the pen?<br>
Tell me can you reminisce on way back when it did begin?<br>
When I look at you, I do not see a friend<br>
When I look at you look at me<br>
