<h1>"Till the End"</h1><br>

[Verse 1]<br>
It's the type of shit that they read about<br>
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out<br>
I've been in the zone, I can't be without<br>
This real shit that I be about<br>
I'm a visionary, that's long term<br>
But Def Jam, said they need it out<br>
If I rush this shit, I might be without<br>
But I need a vision, can't see without<br>
I've been patient, never complacent<br>
Left the underground when I left the basement<br>
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation<br>
On the road with Kid Cudi and B-I-G<br>
Conversations with No I.D<br>
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with JAY<br>
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me<br>
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be<br>
Can't express what that meant to me, what it mean to me<br>
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be<br>
It's so different now, everything is so different now<br>
I've been there and I've done that<br>
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact<br>
And I'm back again cause I love this shit<br>
Write it down and they publish it<br>
I went 5 years without a publicist<br>
'Cause the word of mouth, they in love with this<br>
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming<br>
Went away a while but I've been fiending<br>
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal<br>
Been at it way before the deal<br>
Now the music got mass appeal<br>
My main girl got ass appeal<br>
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing<br>
Little fish, that went mainstream<br>
Now I'm big as fuck<br>
My whole city, they know what's up<br>
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit<br>
I don't give a fuck<br>
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt<br>
If I'm talking business, I might erupt<br>
If you're at the show, put your lighter up<br>
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it<br>
Outsiders, I could do without it<br>
I crept in, got slept on<br>
Sold out shows, no one knew about it<br>
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it<br>
Your cosign, I could do without it<br>
<br>
[Interlude: Dria]<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Okay, last verse I gotta make it count<br>
Won't speak on my bank account<br>
So many commas I'd have to pause<br>
And I can't afford to just waste the bars<br>
Every day, boy, I thank the Lord<br>
I got a lot of problems but could have more<br>
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less<br>
I been hungry like Budapest<br>
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck<br>
I just know I'm blessed<br>
Love life even though I'm stressed<br>
This business boy, I swear a test<br>
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check<br>
I'll send Chris to go cut they neck<br>
I love the building, no disrespect<br>
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect<br>
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet<br>
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist<br>
I'ma intercept, It's my time<br>
Put half a mil' of my own money in this album<br>
That's my dime; no rap features, just my rhymes<br>
My story, it's all mine, from the basement to the stadium<br>
From the Roxy to Palladium<br>
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that<br>
With this pretty girl on my floor<br>
Half naked playing Connect Four<br>
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window<br>
Just to connect more<br>
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind<br>
And then unwind with some slow head<br>
All my homies like, "go 'head"<br>
Anyway, it's been a long time<br>
And this here has been a long rhyme, so I gotta go<br>
It's Logic, the one nobody would vouch for<br>
How's that shit for an outro?<br>
<br>
[Interlude: Dria]<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
This is my story, 'til the end<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
This is my story, 'til the end<br>
<br>
[Break]<br>
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Y-Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Yeah yeah<br>
<br>
[Sample]<br>
"Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them!<br>
They may be misinformed about the truth, they may be misguided— somebody has led them on the wrong path!<br>
A path of corruption and destruction! But yet, God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved!"<br>
<br>
[Break]<br>
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Y-Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Yeah yeah<br>
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Y-Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Yeah yeah<br>
<br>
[Outro: Thalia]<br>
This concludes the Under Pressure program...<br>
