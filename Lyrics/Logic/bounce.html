<h1>"Bounce"</h1><br>

  [Verse 1]<br>
  Living good, I've been living good<br>
  Rolling through my hood, understood<br>
  Just a youngin in this bitch up to no good<br>
  In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me<br>
  Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties<br>
  Out the blue, like a Crip<br>
  But I never bang, no, they know<br>
  We've been at it way before the fame, ho<br>
  (Way before the fame)<br>
  We've been at it way before the fame, ho<br>
  (Way before the...)<br>
  We've been at it way before the fame, psyche<br>
  Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it<br>
  I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch<br>
  Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit<br>
  No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this<br>
  Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do<br>
  Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue<br>
  I'm coming through, if I see your bitch I bet she coming too<br>
  What it do, we ain't never switch it up, we keep it true<br>
<br>
  [Chorus]<br>
  Out the blue, like a Crip<br>
  But I never bang though<br>
  They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho<br>
  Way before the fame, ho<br>
  At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the fame, at it way before the fame<br>
  We've been at it way before the fame<br>
  (Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)<br>
  (Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)<br>
<br>
  [Verse 2]<br>
  Back again, like I never left<br>
  Had to take a breath<br>
  Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore<br>
  God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam<br>
  They know who I am<br>
  Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce<br>
  Fuck it, make it count<br>
  With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa<br>
  Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla<br>
  It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross<br>
  Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world<br>
  Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl<br>
  RattPack, know the deal<br>
  What's the motto? Keep it real!<br>
  (I know) I got it, I want it, I need it<br>
  We live in an era where they get deleted<br>
  I'm wondering if I'ma make it<br>
  Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it<br>
  These bitches they love it, but I never covet<br>
  I just keep it going that's why I be flowing<br>
  I'm already knowing this life that I'm living<br>
  Don't know what I'm given<br>
  It's so hard not to give in<br>
<br>
  [Chorus]<br>
  Out the blue, like a Crip<br>
  But I never bang though<br>
  They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho<br>
  Way before the fame, ho<br>
  At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)<br>
  Way before the fame, at it way before the fame<br>
  We've been at it way before the fame<br>
  (Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)<br>
  (Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)<br>
<br>
  [Outro: Thalia]<br>
