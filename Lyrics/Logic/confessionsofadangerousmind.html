<h1>"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I can't get no better, can’t get no more cheddar<br>
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta<br>
I been made a livin', I'm never gon’ give in<br>
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'<br>
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I’m fallin’<br>
The world think I'm ballin’ and maybe I am<br>
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'<br>
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am<br>
Or who I’m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright<br>
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night<br>
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might<br>
Got 'em all in my sight<br>
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am<br>
I know I'm the man<br>
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security<br>
Everyone deal with they own insecurity<br>
Even the preacher was born with impurity<br>
Scared to go out even with my security<br>
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity<br>
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow<br>
Hope my anxiety stay on the low<br>
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow<br>
Where do I go? What would you do<br>
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?<br>
What would you do if you did it all?<br>
If you ain't never have to lift a finger<br>
Would you linger like, "Fuck 'em all"?<br>
Guess that's your call, but I can't<br>
This a marathon, not a sprint<br>
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint<br>
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
What's your name? What's your game?<br>
Come now, boy, just spit your flow<br>
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?<br>
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'<br>
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know<br>
What's your name? What's your game?<br>
Come now, boy, just spit your flow<br>
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?<br>
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'<br>
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know<br>
<br>
[Interlude]<br>
How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)<br>
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)<br>
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)<br>
Down, roll it up, yeah<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits<br>
Only led me to battle depression<br>
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain<br>
What if your life was under a glass?<br>
And people tried to dig up shit from your past<br>
And tell you what's good and what's not<br>
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot<br>
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart<br>
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers<br>
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'<br>
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'<br>
Fuck social media<br>
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap<br>
They always compare, they always compare me to others<br>
And try to hit me up against all my brothers<br>
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?<br>
(Overdosin' at the crib)<br>
'Cause people just won't let 'em live<br>
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em<br>
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside<br>
And they wonder why we all hide, shit<br>
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'<br>
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'<br>
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate<br>
Sit in the corner and think of a better day<br>
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away<br>
I just cannot seem to think of a better way<br>
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'<br>
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'<br>
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag<br>
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least<br>
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)<br>
'Cause "you'll never be Kenny"<br>
"You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole"<br>
"You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old," yeah<br>
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now<br>
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down<br>
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown<br>
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound<br>
And play it when nobody else is around<br>
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground<br>
God, give me the power to battle depression<br>
Yeah, round after round<br>
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich<br>
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch<br>
But be careful what you wish for<br>
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be<br>
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be<br>
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division<br>
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am<br>
Do what you love and do not give a damn<br>
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram<br>
Just mind your own business and be a good man<br>
Be a good boss and be a good friend<br>
Spread your imagination to the millions<br>
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions<br>
Just spread that positivity for the children<br>
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em<br>
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em<br>
Know somebody feel 'em<br>
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf<br>
And remember, love yourself<br>
Nah, nah, nah<br>
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself<br>
Nah, nah, nah<br>
Put your ego on the shelf<br>
And remember, love your—'member, love yourself<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Nah, nah, nah<br>
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself<br>
Nah, nah, nah<br>
<br><br>
