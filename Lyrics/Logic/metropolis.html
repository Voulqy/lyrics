<h1>"Metropolis"</h1><br>

[Verse 1]<br>
Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted<br>
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted<br>
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki<br>
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly<br>
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go<br>
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto<br>
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago<br>
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die<br>
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing<br>
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh<br>
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me<br>
All that competition right there is dead to me<br>
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages<br>
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous<br>
Boy, I've been feeling courageous<br>
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages<br>
Feels like I'm running through mazes<br>
Everybody has they phases<br>
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this<br>
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it<br>
One of the few that be killing it, uh<br>
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living<br>
On the road to success so you know that I'm driven<br>
But they didn't wanna publish it<br>
But right now I'm on some other shit<br>
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl<br>
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme<br>
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills<br>
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would<br>
<br>
[Refrain 1]<br>
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone<br>
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude<br>
I look out the window like Goddamn, that's what I really do<br>
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain<br>
If I look back on it I would do it all over again<br>
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in<br>
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again<br>
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor<br>
Crazy, racist, white bitch looking at us<br>
Like, "Who are these niggas?"<br>
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash<br>
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash<br>
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain<br>
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane<br>
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam<br>
Oh my God, this is my jam<br>
"May-December" by Mos Def<br>
In my headphones, that's the man<br>
<br>
[Refrain 2]<br>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own<br>
These thoughts inside my mind be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone<br>
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?<br>
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away<br>
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am<br>
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van<br>
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala<br>
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah<br>
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers<br>
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer<br>
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this<br>
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice<br>
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive<br>
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive<br>
<br>
[Skit: Logic & Anna]<br>
I can't believe you don't like Tarantino<br>
Ugh, I don't like him because, like—when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie—<br>
You mean like Inglourious Basterds?—I didn't see that<br>
What?!—I didn't, I don't know—<br>
Oh my God! Have you seen 'Pulp Fiction'?<br>
Yeah, but I don't really remember it<br>
What you talking about? Have you seen uh... this is funny cause we're on a train... have you seen—fuck! What's his name? The guy from the movie, in the place, on the thing?<br>
On the train? With the scenery?<br>
Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit—'Source Code'!<br>
No—You haven't seen that?<br>
No—With the dude from 'Donnie Darko'?<br>
Who's that?—Oh my God<br>
Well, I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is...<br>
My favorite Tarantino movie—?<br>
<br>
[Refrain 2]<br>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
And they wonder why I never get high<br>
<br>
