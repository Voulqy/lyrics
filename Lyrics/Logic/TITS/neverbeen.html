<h1>"Never Been"</h1><br>

[Chorus 1]<br>
I've been workin' like I've never been<br>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<br>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<br>
What I know right now<br>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
You ever wonder what it all really means?<br>
Heart full of dreams?<br>
I know I'ma do it, go get it by any means<br>
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends<br>
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems<br>
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies you never will<br>
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill<br>
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill<br>
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will<br>
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension<br>
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention<br>
You say you would if you had the money<br>
Don't make me mention<br>
It don't cost nothin' but time for you to pay attention<br>
Now don't get me wrong<br>
I know there's people out there hatin' on ya<br>
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya<br>
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak<br>
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak<br>
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative<br>
Talk all you want about me homie, I'ma let it live<br>
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive<br>
Hatin' in your blood, you was born to be negative<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2]<br>
Never been<br>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<br>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<br>
What I know right now<br>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
This is dedicated to everyone that never made it<br>
And the people that persevered even though they was hated<br>
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion<br>
But on the real, the road to success is prone to collision<br>
And every now and then something happens that's unexpected<br>
Like that newborn in your life 'cause you was fuckin' unprotected<br>
And I swear nobody perfect, hell, I know I ain't<br>
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint<br>
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can<br>
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man<br>
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow, teach 'em everything I know<br>
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe<br>
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong<br>
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song<br>
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son<br>
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun<br>
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one<br>
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run<br>
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one<br>
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one<br>
<br>
[Chorus 1 (Extended)]<br>
I've been workin' like I've never been<br>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<br>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<br>
What I know right now<br>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<br>
I've been workin' like I've never been<br>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<br>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<br>
What I know right now<br>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<br>
I've been workin' like I've never been<br>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<br>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<br>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Um, you like that take? I like it<br>
Yeah, should I make it more surreal though, or...<br>
I think it's good, hey Bobby run it!<br>
