<h1>"City of Stars"</h1><br>

[Verse 1]<br>
I know that you think this song is for you<br>
I used to long for you and adore you<br>
My life was just fine way back before you<br>
Now when you reach out I just ignore you<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
'Cause this ain't a love song (Whoa)<br>
This is, "So long"<br>
You did me so wrong for so long<br>
For so long, for so long<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
No, I never thought I could live my life without you<br>
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
And so I doubt you<br>
I doubt you even know what's on my mind<br>
I said, I doubt you<br>
I doubt you even know why I left you behind<br>
<br>
[Interlude]<br>
I know that I've been living<br>
I know that I've been living<br>
I know that I've been living<br>
I know that I've been living<br>
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars<br>
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars<br>
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars<br>
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
This ain't a love song (Whoa)<br>
This is, "So long"<br>
You did me so wrong for so long<br>
For so long, for so long<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
And so I doubt you<br>
I doubt you even know what's on my mind<br>
I said I doubt you<br>
I doubt you even know why I left you—<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Yeah, uh, yeah...<br>
Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me<br>
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me<br>
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me<br>
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me<br>
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album<br>
But black vs. white bullshit was the still the outcome<br>
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go?<br>
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow<br>
Who gives a fuck who made it? I penetrate it and innovate it<br>
While they emulate it, give a fuck if I'm hated<br>
I'ma do it 'til I get it, fuck a nominated<br>
Bitch, I dominate it<br>
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID<br>
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E<br>
Not many get to do what I do, and now enemies<br>
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me<br>
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone<br>
Outside of this solar system, I'm searching for paradise<br>
Livin' the life, bitch, I've been a vet<br>
Fuck all these cats on the internet<br>
I love hip-hop and I hate hip-hop<br>
'Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot<br>
'Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sakes<br>
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break<br>
Now, I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game<br>
We all people, all equal—now let me let off, yeah<br>
Now let me let off<br>
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify<br>
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by<br>
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones<br>
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone<br>
Switch flows, fuck 'em up—play the game, run 'em up<br>
Yeah, I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck<br>
All the people want is real, guess that's why Logic appeal<br>
All the power in the world; hold that, tell me how that feel?<br>
Racism on television and magazines<br>
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn<br>
Country don't give a fuck who I am<br>
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand<br>
And I am, here's to the Roc<br>
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop—shot<br>
And I am, finally on top; too high up, not a drop<br>
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap<br>
I am, livin' like I ain't got it<br>
Spit the flow so robotic, man who gives a fuck about it<br>
Maryland 'til I die, but I had to get the fuck up out it<br>
I love it and hate it, you probably don't know, man, I doubt it<br>
<br><br>
