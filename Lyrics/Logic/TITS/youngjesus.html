<h1>"Young Jesus"</h1><br>

[Intro: Logic & Big Lenbo]<br>
Yeah yeah, what up Bobby<br>
Like goddamn, like goddamn<br>
This that 9-5 shit right here<br>
Take 'em back to the 90s!<br>
Like goddamn, like goddamn<br>
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo yo<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Logic]<br>
Okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice<br>
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists<br>
Take them back to way back when, like Dennis the Menace<br>
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice<br>
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant<br>
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant<br>
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance<br>
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant<br>
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant<br>
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence<br>
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce<br>
'Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic<br>
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis<br>
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate<br>
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it<br>
I'm, forever alone in my mind (yeah yeah)<br>
See I'm a self diagnosed hypochondriac<br>
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at<br>
Yeah, I know that I'm livin' like I got it okay, yeah<br>
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah<br>
<br>
[Hook: Logic]<br>
Over here, over here<br>
Over here, over here<br>
Over here, over here<br>
Over here, over here<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Big Lenbo & Logic]<br>
Ayo, fuck all that, it's the fat young Jesus; flow prestigious<br>
Stackin' money and playin' the field man like Regis<br>
Better believe us or leave us<br>
Grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like, "woo-hah"<br>
I went from surveyin' to Super Saiyan slayin' the man<br>
Bitches want an autograph<br>
I sign them titties in crayon, like goddamn!<br>
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists<br>
It's me and B-I, B-I, B-I-G L-N-B-O, L-N-B-O<br>
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie<br>
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie<br>
I'm unscannable, young cannibal, eat wack MCs like Hannibal<br>
'Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal<br>
<br>
[Hook: Logic]<br>
Over here, over here<br>
Over here, over here<br>
Over here, over here<br>
Over here, over here<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Logic & Big Lenbo]<br>
Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious<br>
The young Spiegel, interstellar with my retrieval<br>
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval<br>
I spit at it like a Beretta<br>
You know I get better by givin' the people<br>
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'<br>
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden<br>
"The Return of the Jedi"<br>
Bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye<br>
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do<br>
This shit is (overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through)<br>
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio<br>
Ay dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo<br>
To hold a brother down like the white man<br>
Fuck that nigga<br>
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff<br>
Even in a pair of cuffs, know we always keep it real<br>
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man<br>
I'm just (301 reppin', second I step in Maryland)<br>
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon<br>
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love<br>
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this<br>
Throw a Molotov in your crib<br>
And tell them bitches to bill us, we the illest<br>
Finger fuck a critic<br>
Shit is darker than "The Chronicles of Riddick"<br>
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it<br>
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom<br>
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on<br>
<br><br>
