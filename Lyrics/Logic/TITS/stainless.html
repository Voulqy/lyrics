<h1>"Stainless"</h1><br>

[Intro: Logic]<br>
It's 2 bars? Aight...<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Logic]<br>
Motherfuckers wanna get famous bust guns and get dangerous<br>
(dangerous)<br>
Daddy graduated from Cambridge yeah, money talks in every language<br>
Real recognize that stainless, silver spoon what my aim is<br>
Y'all don't know what that game is, y'all don't know what that, uh<br>
Y'all 'bout that fraternity life<br>
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come<br>
Baby girl gon' be about that maternity life<br>
If you do like my daddy then she gonna be single and alone<br>
That maternity life for eternity life<br>
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life<br>
Cause we do what we do, but hold up let me get it right<br>
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems<br>
But not everybody need a .45 to solve them, revolve them (ba-ba-ba-ba)<br>
Take care of all of them like this, I might just go crazy all the way<br>
Y'all live that life where your safety is only a call away<br>
But not us, mommy and daddy never bought us<br>
Not a god damn thing but they brought us<br>
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust<br>
Outside run around with a gun to bust<br>
Police looking for every one of us<br>
Back then yeah all of that was fun to us<br>
Had a little bit of money in the middle, let me hit 'em with a riddle<br>
If I never had a dark night I might not-not-not—<br>
Not be the same—might not be the—<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Logic]<br>
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over<br>
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Dria]<br>
Ay, hey now boy?<br>
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy<br>
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac<br>
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town<br>
South Central with the gang, gang, gang<br>
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat<br>
Get the fuck up off your silver<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Logic]<br>
Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average<br>
They cutthroat yeah they savage<br>
They riding round with the baddest (bitch)<br>
One day I woke up, and said I'm bout to do this<br>
For the rest of my life, no question it's right<br>
Waiting for the bus at a stop light<br>
Looking at the cop right in front of my eyes<br>
Living in a world of lies, where the truth dies<br>
And hatred multiplies—mu-mu-mu-multi—<br>
Multiplies, I said I can't take it<br>
I remember wondering if I would ever make it<br>
But as I reminisce I realise it was all irrelevant, it's evident<br>
I'm getting money for the hell of it<br>
Never fuck around, so the flow celibate<br>
Speaking for the people like a delegate<br>
And when the situation's delicate<br>
I execute it with the proper etiquette<br>
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no, I can't take the time to stop<br>
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top<br>
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop<br>
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in<br>
While the whole world spin for the dividend<br>
But I'm in another system<br>
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em<br>
Why can't we relax and listen?<br>
Stop spending money on things that glisten-glisten-glisten-glisten<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Logic]<br>
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over<br>
I Know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Dria]<br>
Ay, hey now boy?<br>
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy<br>
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac<br>
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town<br>
South Central with the gat gat gat<br>
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat<br>
Get the fuck up off your silver spoon<br>
