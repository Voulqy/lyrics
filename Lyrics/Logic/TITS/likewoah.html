<h1>"Like Woah"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Aye, this that shit<br>
I'm looking at you 6ix<br>
I've been feeling like a...<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I've been feeling like a mothafuckin' postman<br>
Sending letters to the people<br>
All this knowledge that I got, I'm like an old man<br>
Hold up, wait now oh man!<br>
Let me back up in this bitch<br>
I'm platinum in this bitch, I'm rapping in this bitch<br>
Running the game, yeah I've been lappin' in this bitch<br>
You know it's alright<br>
Fuck around and they all might<br>
Look at a brother different, I've been at it all night<br>
I think I said it but I know I do it<br>
This for everybody going through it<br>
<br>
[Hook 1]<br>
Like woah<br>
Through it like woah<br>
Through it like woah<br>
Going through it like woah<br>
You already know<br>
You already know<br>
Gotta get it like woah<br>
In this bitch like woah<br>
Get it like, like, like woah<br>
Let's go—uh, I'ma get it like woah<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Back up in this mothafucka livin' like a goddamn king<br>
Tell me money ain't a thing now<br>
30 thousand feet above the world right next to the wing<br>
Too high to hear the birds sing now<br>
All around the world and back again it's finally happenin'<br>
I'm lappin' in this luxury by nappin' in a big ass house<br>
Chillin' with my homies on the West side, West side<br>
Bringin' out my best side<br>
I was on the road for like a quarter I was in and out the border<br>
From London to Paris, yes it's very extraordinary<br>
Fuck around and took the bus and a ferry<br>
Should've seen the itinerary<br>
Then we made it back home like woah<br>
Tell me how you're feelin', higher than the ceilin'<br>
I know I've been illin'<br>
Probably wonder where I'm at, bitch I've been chillin'<br>
Why they grillin'? Yeah I'm still in like I never left<br>
They know I had to go but then I brought it right back<br>
<br>
[Hook 2]<br>
Like woah<br>
Do it like woah<br>
Do it like woah<br>
Going through it like woah<br>
You already know<br>
You already know<br>
Gotta get it like woah<br>
In this bitch like woah<br>
Get it like, like, like woah<br>
Let's go—Uh, I'ma get it like woah<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I get so high they wonder why no I can't go away<br>
I gotta hold my own, know that's the only way<br>
I've been vibin', let me guide em, I said I gotta know<br>
I've been ridin' for so long I think that it's time to go<br>
Feeling like an addict that ain't had it, up and at it in a minute<br>
If it hadn't been invented, my limit wouldn't be infinite<br>
I'm feeling like an infant in a womb, I'ma be here 'til the tomb<br>
Lately I've been in my room<br>
Lookin' and lookin' at records on the wall<br>
Hold up—<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Like woah<br>
<br>
[Skit: Kevin Randolph (as Joseph Kai)]<br>
Yeah I hope we make it to fuckin' paradise and not die on the way there, mothafucka...<br>
