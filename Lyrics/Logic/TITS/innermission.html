<h1>"Innermission"</h1><br>

[Verse 1: Logic]<br>
Sometimes I fantasize about traveling space and time<br>
I think about specific moments that I could rewind<br>
Not to redo it, but relive it, I could give it one more go, abide<br>
And truly understand the deeper things<br>
That I don't know about<br>
Now take a trip with me and vibe<br>
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?<br>
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe<br>
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive<br>
I'm gonna take this moment right now<br>
Here and school them people<br>
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal<br>
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people<br>
Truly wish that I could, check it<br>
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world<br>
I see like different light, this music shit just ain't the world<br>
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters<br>
All different colors and creeds all come together for me<br>
Boy, I'm blessed to be free, uh<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Lucy Rose]<br>
This is our time<br>
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind<br>
This is our ride<br>
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Logic]<br>
Doing 70 on this highway<br>
On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open<br>
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping<br>
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in<br>
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit<br>
It's been like 3 months since I've been home<br>
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone<br>
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on<br>
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it<br>
Let me bring 'em back<br>
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever<br>
My endeavor like a feature film<br>
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?<br>
I'm in it, my limit the chillest<br>
Let me bring 'em back, yo<br>
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing<br>
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing<br>
But I'm testing, reminiscing<br>
When I would listen to my intuition<br>
And now I made it, resurrecting<br>
Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated<br>
It seem like everyone's somehow related<br>
Letters back and forth from my homie<br>
That's locked up in prison<br>
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him<br>
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man<br>
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in<br>
What if the tables was turned<br>
And I was the one that been in, damn<br>
He said he's seen me in the magazine<br>
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel<br>
That's been my dog from the kennel<br>
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one<br>
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun<br>
Skipping class with all of my homies<br>
On a constant search for who I was<br>
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because<br>
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs<br>
I never graduated but I made it to the summit<br>
Don't get me wrong, so many times<br>
I thought that I would plummet<br>
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem<br>
To stomach all of the beef around my way<br>
I mean, I never wanted to live a life<br>
Where all you're truly living is a lie<br>
I knew I always wanted more<br>
And so they wonder why, I said they wonder why<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Lucy Rose]<br>
This is our time<br>
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind<br>
This is our ride<br>
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind<br>
<br>
[Skit]<br>
So what do you think about space?<br>
Um, space is called the galaxy...<br>
Do you know planets?<br>
What are—can you name some planets off?<br>
Yeah, there's a one named Saturn and Earth<br>
Mars—and the planet Paradise<br>
You've never been there before?<br>
Um, no. I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in the coolest ship. My TV showed us where we are in space—<br>
But there was droid ships everywhere...<br>
Well, thank you for your time, sir<br>
I appreciate the interview...<br>
