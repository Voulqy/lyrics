<h1>"Wizard of Oz"</h1><br>

[Chorus]<br>
Bitch, I've been runnin' my city like I am the Wizard of Oz<br>
I don't do this shit for nothin' but the family and the squad<br>
Money ain't everything, tell me now, what's that money to a god?<br>
If they tell you money make you better than others, then somebody lied<br>
Bitch, I've been runnin' my city like I am the Wizard of Oz (yeah, I am)<br>
I don't do this shit for nothin' but the family and the squad (squad)<br>
Money ain't everything, tell me now, what's that money to a god? (to a god)<br>
If they tell you money make you better than others, then somebody lied (somebody lied)<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
I just paid ten million in taxes<br>
Finger-fuck all of them bastards way back in my GED classes<br>
I don't mean to stunt on they asses, but I'm finna stunt on they asses<br>
Yeah, I'm finna stunt on they asses<br>
Fast forward, I rap for the masses, from Maryland to Calabasas<br>
It's on, all this other shit that's on my mind now<br>
My girl said she wanna let me find out<br>
I'm way too diverse to stay in one lane<br>
Increase the autotune so y'all could feel the pain (yeah, yeah!)<br>
Pour that drink up and might have to catch a vibe (catch a vibe!)<br>
I am way too turnt right now, don't need to drive (woo!)<br>
I might fuck around and say some real shit (yeah!)<br>
Like people tend to do when they get real, real lit, yeah (woo!)<br>
I've been sippin' on that liquid courage (ooh, ooh, yeah!)<br>
The beat is tellin' me, "Don't be discouraged"<br>
I think I'm the best rapper alive<br>
'Cause they tell me I'm the best rapper alive<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Bitch, I've been runnin' my city like I am the Wizard of Oz<br>
I don't do this shit for nothin' but the family and the squad<br>
Money ain't everything, tell me now, what's that money to a god?<br>
If they tell you money make you better than others, then somebody lied<br>
Bitch, I've been runnin' my city like I am the Wizard of Oz (yeah, I am)<br>
I don't do this shit for nothin' but the family and the squad (squad)<br>
