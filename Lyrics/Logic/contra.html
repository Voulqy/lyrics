[Verse 2]<br>
Let that bitch breathe<br>
Most of these people can't never ever comprehend all the shit that I've seen<br>
I am polite than a mothafucka, but when I grip that mic I get mean<br>
Come now, you know what I mean<br>
Pepe done got the boy lean<br>
Yeah, you could doubt me, say what you want 'bout me<br>
But I am a rappin' machine<br>
I do this shit for the team, shit for the squad<br>
I'm livin' the dream, yes, I am livin' the dream<br>
Hold up, wait up, just can't believe<br>
Just can't believe that my swag is on another level<br>
Yeah, I keep it G<br>
Matter of fact, I keep it, I keep it, I keep it, I keep it M<br>
Turn that shit upside down, now it's a W<br>
No, no, ain't nobody fuckin' with him<br>
Don't matter who come stand next to me<br>
Once I'm surrounded ain't nobody fuckin' with them<br>
I am the best of the best, of the best<br>
Of the best, of the best, of the best like, Men In Black<br>
Greatest alive, bitch, I've been that<br>
If you don't agree, you get kidnapped<br>
Bitch slapped, thrown back, like woo!<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Yeah, get it like, get it like, get it like, get it like me, nah<br>
