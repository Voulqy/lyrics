<h1>"Yuck"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
My name is Paul Rothenberg, Attorney of Law...<br>
And I hereby ratify and confirm that Logic is motherfucking paid<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Can't nothin' stop me, I'm on a roll (I'm on a roll!)<br>
Always on time 'cause my eyes is on my Rollie-olex<br>
I don't trust nobody, oh no (No, no, no!)<br>
I don't trust nobody, put my homies on the payroll<br>
Fuck with me now or you'll never know (Never know!)<br>
If you weren't with me, in the beginning, you get no love (No love!)<br>
My name Bobby Tarantino (Tarantino! Yeah)<br>
Logic ain't here right now, leave a message if you want, ho<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Hold it, bring it back, uh, I'ma call you back, uh<br>
Too busy countin' stacks, uh<br>
Pickin' up the slack (slack!)<br>
I was born in the trap (trap!), chains on, cooked crack (Crack!)<br>
Logic never wanna flex, but Bobby finna bring the facts<br>
Put my city on the map, fuck with the gang, get attacked<br>
It ain't a thing, RattPack, nobody know about that<br>
Bitch, I been gunnin', comin' for the throne<br>
And I know that they talking, can't fuck with the tone<br>
Talkin' shit 'bout Logic, I never respond<br>
I'll let success talk, 'cause a word of advice:<br>
More achievements for yourself and less talk<br>
Cats beef with Logic, yeah, they prayin' I respond<br>
If I ever did, I dead you in this game with no respawn<br>
Peace, love, and positivity, that's all I want with you<br>
But you push the issue 'cause I give you more press than your publicist could ever get you<br>
Hell nah, fuck rap, fuck beef<br>
Anyone that hate me, I wish you success<br>
I wish you look in the mirror and ask yourself why you suppressed<br>
The feelin's of self-hatred that you want project on me<br>
Bet if I never picked up the mic then we might be homies<br>
But you jealous, you look at my life and you feel envy<br>
Constantly comparing yourself to me and feel empty<br>
Most people that don't fuck with me ain't never shook my hand<br>
I'm a good man, yeah, I love myself<br>
I know who I am, yeah, I love myself<br>
They don't understand<br>
But no matter what happen you know that–<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Can't nothing stop me, I'm on a roll (I'm on a roll)<br>
Always on time 'cause my eyes is on my Rollie-olex (Woo!)<br>
I don't trust nobody, oh no (No, no, no!)<br>
I don't trust nobody, put my homies on the payroll<br>
Fuck with me now or you'll never know (Never know!)<br>
If you weren't with me, in the beginning, you get no love (No love!)<br>
My name Bobby Tarantino (Tarantino!)<br>
Logic ain't here right now, leave a message if you want, ho (Leave a message, ho!)<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Hi! It's uh—Logic? Hi, sorry. It's Elton John calling you! Um, I hope you don't mind me getting you on your mobile–or not getting on your mobile, but I was just, uh—congratulating you first of all on your performance at the Grammys and then I was asking you—I was gonna ask you if you'd like to do something for me, and I will ring you back later and see—and talk about it, thanks!<br>
