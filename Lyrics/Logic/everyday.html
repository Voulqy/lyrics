<h1>"Everyday"</h1><br>

[Intro]<br>
Yeah, ayy<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I work hard every motherfuckin' day-ay-ay-ayy<br>
I work hard, I work hard every day-ay-ay-ayy, yeah<br>
But today is my day, it's my day<br>
And no matter what they say, it's my day<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Roll up to the spot, feelin' real good<br>
Think you gon' talk shit, you better not, my homies real hood<br>
They say, "Logic, why you do that?" I don't know, I don't know<br>
Yeah, they used to be like, "Who that?" I don't know, I don't know<br>
Now they know my name wherever I go<br>
Used to think that's what I wanted, but now just don't know<br>
No, I can't fuck with that, knuck if you buckin' back<br>
Yeah, I been workin' but I ain't get nothin' back<br>
Tell me the dealy now, hold up, wait, really now<br>
All of that shit you been talkin' just silly now<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Just as quick as you rise<br>
Just as quick as you could fall<br>
Oh, no, no, no, I can't fuck with that at all<br>
Can't fuck with that at all<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I work hard every motherfuckin' day-ay-ay-ayy<br>
I work hard, I work hard every day-ay-ay-ayy, yeah<br>
But today is my day, it's my day<br>
And no matter what they say, it's my day<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la, yeah<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
All, all she ever wanted was attention<br>
And a bunch of other shit I shouldn't mention<br>
'Cause she got daddy issues for days, for days and days<br>
But today, she ain't got shit to do<br>
Her right along with you<br>
So we gon' fuck around and vibe, and vibe, and vibe, and vibe<br>
I'm tryna live my life, but am I doing it right?<br>
Yeah, I'm tryna live my life, but am I doing it right?<br>
'Cause they tell me I'm the man<br>
You the man right now, you the man right now<br>
With the whole wide world in the palm of your hand right now<br>
Fuck the lights and the cameras and the money and the fame<br>
I'ma do it for the fam right now<br>
I'ma get it for the 301 and the R-A-double T-P-A-C 'cause you know<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I work hard every motherfuckin' day-ay-ay-ayy<br>
I work hard, I work hard every day-ay-ay-ayy, yeah<br>
But today is my day, it's my day<br>
And no matter what they say, it's my day<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la, yeah, yeah<br>
