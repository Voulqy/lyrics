<h1>"Homocide"</h1><br>

[Intro: Smokey Legendary, Logic & Both]<br>
Son, you know why you the greatest alive?<br>
Why, Dad?<br>
Because you came out of my balls, nigga<br>
Hahahahahaha<br>
(Roof!)<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
Fuck rap<br>
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic<br>
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back<br>
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive<br>
Leave a suicide note, fuck that<br>
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this<br>
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby<br>
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Logic]<br>
I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out<br>
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about<br>
And I dare you to test me<br>
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me<br>
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration<br>
But I'm full of innovation<br>
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap shit<br>
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit<br>
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame<br>
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame<br>
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em<br>
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself<br>
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself<br>
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health<br>
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?<br>
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit<br>
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit<br>
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit<br>
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?<br>
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
Fuck rap<br>
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic<br>
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back<br>
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive<br>
Leave a suicide note, fuck that<br>
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this<br>
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby<br>
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika-chika<br>
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Logic]<br>
There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide<br>
Hit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die<br>
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide<br>
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes<br>
No, we ain't fuckin' with that<br>
Yeah, there's a time and a place<br>
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps<br>
Callin' yourself the greatest alive<br>
Then you don't deserve to do that<br>
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that<br>
You gon' get smacked<br>
You gon' make Bobby attack<br>
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap<br>
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Logic]<br>
Fuck rap<br>
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic<br>
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back<br>
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive<br>
Leave a suicide note, fuck that<br>
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this<br>
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby<br>
I'm feelin' like I'm chika-chika-chika-chika<br>
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Eminem]<br>
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z<br>
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything<br>
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing<br>
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees<br>
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy<br>
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover<br>
Your body goes limp and slumps over<br>
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered<br>
Hol' up, I said "Rover" because now your Rover is red<br>
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant<br>
But I roll over my opponents instead<br>
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down<br>
I'll go slow for the speds<br>
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said<br>
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)<br>
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit<br>
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw<br>
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow<br>
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?<br>
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes<br>
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T<br>
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though<br>
'Cause MCs know<br>
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts<br>
Your shit is ass like a tailbone<br>
Or you're trapped in your cell phone<br>
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe<br>
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote<br>
Used to get beat up by the big kids<br>
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel<br>
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still<br>
Now money's not a big deal<br>
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'<br>
Big bills like a platypus<br>
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis<br>
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'<br>
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate<br>
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin<br>
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again<br>
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back<br>
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap<br>
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire<br>
With a Derringer with a hair trigger<br>
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper<br>
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil<br>
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct<br>
I'm about to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it<br>
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket<br>
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra<br>
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it<br>
What? Dracula, fuck that shit<br>
I'm up, back with a thud<br>
Man, stop<br>
<br>
[Outro: Chris D'Elia]<br>
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to<br>
Do all this while ya panickin'<br>
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins<br>
And I'm goin' to Fanagans<br>
Trying to get up a plan against<br>
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans<br>
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana<br>
You're in a cab-<br>
I'm in a cabana and a Janet<br>
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter<br>
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina<br>
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford<br>
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards<br>
While I'm world tourin'<br>
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins<br>
Lapkins and chapki-<br>
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'<br>
Flappin' around like a bapkin'<br>
Flamminababbitapannitajampkin<br>
Dammit, a can of pada-<br>
<br><br>
