<h1>"Buried Alive"</h1><br>

[Chorus]<br>
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)<br>
I feel like the grass is green<br>
And everything I do is unseen<br>
But I know that’s just in my mind<br>
I know everything is just in my mind<br>
Do you really wanna be famous?<br>
Do you really wanna be a superstar?<br>
Do you really wanna get dangerous?<br>
Do you even know where the groupies are?<br>
Bitches out here be shameless<br>
And I really wonder where they parents are<br>
Look around, everything changes<br>
It feels like I've been buried alive<br>
Buried alive<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Everything happens for a reason<br>
Happens for a reason<br>
People only in your life for seasons<br>
Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)<br>
Uh, death and taxes that’s all we given<br>
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'<br>
You can make it work but that still ain't driven<br>
Give a lot but that still ain't givin'<br>
Livin' life like this ain’t real though<br>
Every night like this I feel so dead wrong<br>
Collision is head on, my vision is dead and gone<br>
Perception of right and wrong<br>
I been here so very long right here in this very song, uh<br>
Look around everything changes<br>
Seem like everybody just strangers<br>
Don’t go outside 'cause it’s dangerous<br>
Why everybody wanna be famous<br>
I’m so OCD, if they notice me<br>
I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me<br>
Man, everybody want this shit for free<br>
Hand out, palm up when they get to me<br>
In my mind, no, I never let it get to me<br>
Everybody got a time, will it get to me?<br>
V’s up motherfucka, that’s victory<br>
Tell me why what I’m doing ain’t shit to me, damn<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Buried alive (Buried alive)<br>
Will I survive? (Buried alive)<br>
I gotta know<br>
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know<br>
I gotta know<br>
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know<br>
It feels like I’ve been buried alive<br>
Buried alive<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)<br>
I feel like the grass is green<br>
And everything I do is unseen<br>
But I know that’s just in my mind<br>
I know everything is just in my mind<br>
Do you really wanna be famous?<br>
Do you really wanna be a superstar?<br>
Do you really wanna get dangerous?<br>
Do you even know where the groupies are?<br>
Bitches out here be shameless<br>
And I really wonder where they parents are<br>
Look around, everything changes<br>
It feels like I've been buried alive<br>
(Let it breathe)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I'm feelin' this villainous feelin' inside of my mind<br>
Every time that I’m willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams<br>
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah<br>
Listen up now, love it or hate it<br>
Never debate it, you can never degrade it<br>
While all these other motherfuckers<br>
Probably thinking I made it<br>
My mind jaded, no—I never evade it<br>
I elevate it just to keep it innovative (innovative)<br>
God damn, bring it back now, blowin' up like Iraq now<br>
RattPack put me on the map now<br>
No, we never back down<br>
Just take my time, I just take my time<br>
I know, I'ma get it like this<br>
So everyone know that I did it like this<br>
Yeah, I know—I'ma take my time<br>
Battle the image inside of my mind<br>
I know, I'ma keep going<br>
Tell me I can't but I'm already knowing<br>
I know, I'm gonna rise even though I've been—<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Buried alive (Buried alive)<br>
Will I survive? (Buried alive)<br>
I gotta know<br>
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know<br>
I gotta know<br>
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know<br>
It feels like I’ve been buried alive<br>
Buried alive<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)<br>
I feel like the grass is green<br>
And everything I do is unseen<br>
But I know that’s just in my mind<br>
I know everything is just in my mind<br>
(Let it breathe)<br>
<br>
[Outro: Thalia]<br>
OutKast, A Tribe Called Quest, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and films by Quentin Tarantino were in rotation constantly throughout the duration of this album's creation...<br>
