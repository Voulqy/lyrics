<h1>"Soul Food"</h1><br>

  [Verse 1]<br>
  Goddamn, goddamn—conversations with legends<br>
  Crazy how one day yo' idols can turn into your brethren<br>
  Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us<br>
  Breaking bread like I'm Jesus<br>
  Money ain't everything, but somehow eases<br>
  Better believe than think down and leave us, the baby cryin'<br>
  Crack cooking where my sister be frying soul food<br>
  Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude<br>
  He whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him, I'll kill him<br>
  I'll motherfuckin' kill him<br>
  I said, I really want to kill him—but I can't<br>
  'Cause if I do, po-po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't<br>
  See my vision from pictures I paint<br>
  Do you feel it like I feel it?<br>
  I grip the mic and then kill it—okay, I'm gone<br>
  As memories resurface from hella long in my past<br>
  Chillin’, sippin' Sinatra from a flask<br>
  Little Bobby, just a youngin’, skating was my hobby<br>
  Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery<br>
  Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store<br>
  Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door<br>
  Can’t take no more, mama on drugs, daddy M.I.A<br>
  What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play<br>
  To this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats<br>
  Never stolen, I’m from Maryland<br>
  Where they shoot you in the dark of the night<br>
  Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon<br>
  Catch me rollin’ with the realest<br>
  Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero<br>
  Far from a hero, bitch, I’m De Niro in Goodfellas<br>
  If your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella<br>
  Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa<br>
  Murder the game and then resurrect it like "Thriller"<br>
  Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa<br>
  We don’t do it for the skrilla, we do it for love<br>
  Word to my homies up above, we slingin' like drugs<br>
  And overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)<br>
  Yeah<br>
  <br>
  [Break: Thalia]<br>
  Hip-hop<br>
  <br>
  [Chorus]<br>
  I swear this music in my genes like Denim<br>
  Lyricism seep in 'em like venom<br>
  Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer<br>
  Even though heaven sent him<br>
  <br>
  [Verse 2]<br>
  See my vision as I've elevated and risen<br>
  Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision<br>
  I finally made my way up out that section 8 division<br>
  Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'<br>
  But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings<br>
  While the label only care about making a killin'<br>
  Feel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G<br>
  That's the shit they never see<br>
  But I own supremacy, number one—I better be<br>
  Bitch, I said, "I bet I be."<br>
  Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me<br>
  Tell me, how is they gon' remember me?<br>
  As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?<br>
  Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me<br>
  Just 'cause I was different<br>
  Just 'cause I was doing what I love?<br>
  And the fans they say they love you<br>
  But they push and they shove<br>
  'Cause they want what they want<br>
  How they want when they want it<br>
  I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid<br>
  I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it<br>
  Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted<br>
  While the rest of 'em just worry<br>
  'Bout bitches and getting blunted<br>
  Still that same motherfucker from that YS1<br>
  Only difference is I'm stronger<br>
  And better from when I've begun<br>
  So when people that never knew me<br>
  They tell me that I changed<br>
  That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?<br>
  I just stop, and do my best to refrain<br>
  From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane<br>
  Will I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?<br>
  Give the world everything I have to give?<br>
  This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age<br>
  Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage<br>
  Even though it's in the millions<br>
  That shit don't define my brilliance<br>
  Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions<br>
  Of people that separated, but all equal<br>
  To know the ending, one must understand the prequel, uh<br>
  <br>
  [Chorus]<br>
  I swear this music in my genes like Denim<br>
  Lyricism seep in 'em like venom<br>
  Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer<br>
  Even though heaven sent him<br>
  <br>
  [Outro]<br>
  Spit it like Holy water<br>
  Prophetically repent 'em, then we gone<br>
