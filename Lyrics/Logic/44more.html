<h1>"44 More"</h1><br>

[Verse]<br>
Ayy, bitch, I've been goin' and goin' like the Energizer<br>
Yeah, I'm supplyin' the wood like Elijah<br>
In the cut, smokin' on indica<br>
Might fuck around and compartmentalize ya<br>
They say, they say life is a bitch<br>
And if that is the case then I'm finna surprise her<br>
No, I am not an advisor, but I do advise ya<br>
To pay attention, never need to mention<br>
I'm that motherfucker bustin' heads<br>
Finna push it to the ledge<br>
Yeah, I been smokin' my meds<br>
Ain't got no love for the feds<br>
Can't let fame go to yo head<br>
Fuck with me, watch where you tread<br>
I'm finna kill it instead<br>
I'm finna, I'm finna, I'm finna<br>
I will, I will, do it like I never done it<br>
And I wanna run it and I wanna keep it goin' and goin'<br>
Like infinity, be the only entity to ever rip it apart<br>
From the start like this, from the heart like this<br>
Finna murder it, a million miles a minute, no nitrous<br>
Doin' righteous<br>
I-I been, I-I-I been down this road before<br>
Everybody think that they do but they don't<br>
Swear to God that they would but they won't<br>
Spittin' riddles in the middle of a past-time<br>
Me in my mind, feelin' divine, like yeah<br>
Finna get it like yeah—yeah<br>
Like yeah, like yeah (Woo, woo, woo, woo)<br>
I done made 20 million dollars (Preach)<br>
I don't flex to be acknowledged (Preach)<br>
At this point it's common knowledge (Preach)<br>
All you haters been abolished (Preach)<br>
You in the club throwin' dollars, but I'm savin' mine so my kids go to college (Preach)<br>
Or maybe whatever they wanna do (Preach)<br>
Just as long as they never say (Preach)<br>
"Daddy blew 20 million dollars (Ayy)<br>
He had to flex to be acknowledged (Ayy)<br>
He in the club throwin' dollars<br>
And now cannot afford to send me to college (Ayy)<br>
Daddy just wanna be loved<br>
Just like everybody wanna be accepted (Ayy)<br>
But somehow he had neglected<br>
Me and my momma for all of this rap shit" (Ayy)<br>
No, I cannot fuck with that shit (Ayy)<br>
No, I cannot fuck with that<br>
Who you know dropped an album<br>
Back to back to back to back to back to back again?<br>
I'm back again to snap again<br>
And goddamnit, it ain't no other way around it<br>
Yeah, it's happenin', 'cause I've been livin' in a world on my own<br>
Leave me alone, I'm in the zone<br>
Where I've been prone to destroy shit<br>
You cannot avoid this, whack mothafuckas have annoyed this<br>
Yes, you know I enjoy this<br>
Preach, mothafuckin' preach<br>
Yeah, I'm tryna reach everybody in the streets<br>
Writin' words to the beats<br>
Each one teach one, yeah, I'm tryna reach one<br>
Who the beast one?<br>
That be me, on the top to the East one<br>
Tell me how you really wanna do it right now, time to murder this<br>
Shout out everybody, no fuckin' around, ain't heard of this<br>
Heard of us, we ain't goin' nowhere, it's a herd of us<br>
Hold up, roll up<br>
Levitated like I'm David Blaine<br>
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames<br>
Talk all you want, we are not the same<br>
Step in the spot, now they know the name<br>
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry<br>
If that ain't a sign of the times<br>
Then I don't know what is, man this shit is scary<br>
'Cause bitch, I've been blowin' up like C-4<br>
And I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw<br>
Anybody hatin' on the boy, take a step back and then deep-throat<br>
Now my phone blowin' up like ring<br>
Like ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!<br>
That Kevin Durant, I'm a champion<br>
Check the numbers, I'm a champion<br>
Can't sleep on the boy anymore<br>
But the haters that love to hate gon' pop an Ambien<br>
Star Lord, champion<br>
Know the name, now they know the alias, that's for sure<br>
Gave 'em 44, now here's 44 more<br>
